*Hackertyper project Show-and-Tell, Lab session*

I'd like for you to build something like http://hackertyper.com/!

You can put whatever text you want in there! You can keep the big long string of C++ code (http://hackertyper.com/code.txt), or you can put in the complete text of Moby Dick (you bibliophile, you!), or you could just mash together a bunch of Kanye quotes and call it good! (infinite monkey theorem, amirite?)





Now, theoretically, you _could_ just slightly modify http://hackertyper.com/script.js, throw it on your site, and submit that, and nobody would be the wiser!

...until you list it on your portfolio page and someone asks you how it works :\ that might make for an awkward interview question. I wouldn't recommend copy-pasting this one, even a little bit. *Build it from scratch!*

Here's some things that might help you build this:

- <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=detecting+a+key+press+with+javascript|detecting a key press with javascript>
- <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=declaring+and+incrementing+a+counter+with+javascript|declaring and incrementing a counter with javascript>
