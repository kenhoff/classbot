  - JavaScript originally started as just for the browser, but has since expanded to run just about everywhere. Fun facts - `npm` (which we use to install our Firebase tools) and Atom are both written in JavaScript!

  - One thing that's not as clear in these videos - it's totally possible for us to include scripts inside of `<script>` tags directly in an HTML page, much like we were doing with internal styles.

  - The console is one of the single most valuable debugging tools for web development. It'll show you if you have a syntax error in your script, or if jQuery isn't included and it needs to be, and lots of other things.

  - We'll be using jQuery in a little while. This video actually seems a bit misleading to me, but I wanted to include it just for the last 10 seconds - jQuery will use the same selectors that we're using for CSS. Yay!
