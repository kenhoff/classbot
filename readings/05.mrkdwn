		- We've seen these before, when we were looking at the CSS Box Model. One thing to note here is the use of shorthand styles; e.g. using `margin` instead of `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom` and `margin-left`.

*Flexbox* *(recommended)*

		- I really wish he didn't bring up `inline-flex` in this one - we don't really use it much, and it just ends up being confusing. Ignore it!

		- Setting `margin: auto` on a flex container's child element is one of the secret weapons of web devs. Use it! Ignore the other methods that he uses, unless you really want to understand flexbox more.

		- Skim over this one and bookmark it. This is the literally the best page on the internet for understanding flexbox.

	- This video covers the `display` attributes and the values `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`. One of the cool things that he does in this video is turning a bunch of `<li>` tags into a horizontal list, like a nav menu!

<https://teamtreehouse.com/library/responsive-layouts/media-queries/media-query-review|Media Queries> *(required)*
	- How does Bootstrap's responsiveness work? Media Queries! Chances are you won't need media queries for a long time (because Bootstrap handles all of this stuff for us), *but* they're important to know about, in case you need to go in to modify them.
