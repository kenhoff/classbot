Surprise! No recommended Treehouse watching this week, but there is an optional video. Instead, I'd like you to start exploring *Bootstrap Themes*.

- Click around and start finding your favorite themes on these sites: *(required)*

	- If you want to generate a custom Bootstrap theme, you can always do so by using http://getbootstrap.com/customize/. However, it does require you to know exactly what you want, and plug in all the styles yourself. Probably just be easier to use a prebuilt theme :)
