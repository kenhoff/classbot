	- So far, we've only used *Inline Styles* (the `style` attributes on all of our tags). This video introduces *Internal Styles*, which are `<style>` tags placed in the `<head>` of the page.

	- This video covers the `display` attributes and the values `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`. One of the cool things that he does in this video is turning a bunch of `<li>` tags into a horizontal list, like a nav menu!
