<p>Notes on the end of class
On April 27th at 8pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get sent to Arieann, for internship placement services.
Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects (Client, Lorem Ipsum, and Portfolio)
Remember to check your grades with grades!
Remember to create separate firebase apps for your projects (and that they‚Äôre submitted to the grader for the right assignments), so that potential employers can see them!</p>
<p>Internships?
You don‚Äôt have to do this right now, but if you‚Äôre interested, be sure to do it before April 27th at 8pm.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in Spark‚Äôs help with finding an internship, fill out this form, and select the ‚Äúseeking an internship‚Äù option! Fill out all the other stuff too.
<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/uhKBIJHhzU">http://goo.gl/forms/uhKBIJHhzU</a>
For each student, I usually send a short recommendation to Arieann (along with report cards). If you‚Äôre selected for internship placement services, she‚Äôll get in touch with you via email.</p>
<p>Get a job!
Usually get 5-10 leads a week through the CU CS jobs list!</p>

<p>Google tour, anyone?
My friend recently got a job at the big G, and might be able to get us a tour of their Boulder campus!</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested, go ahead and put a reaction on the Slack message here: <a href="https://sparkfrontendwebdev.slack.com/archives/general/p1460576822000110">https://sparkfrontendwebdev.slack.com/archives/general/p1460576822000110</a>
(or just respond in #general)</p>
<p>Tentative for the morning of April 25th (after the class ends) - that work for folks?</p>
<p>Tonight
on Front End Web Development:</p>
<p>Portfolios!</p>
<p>Final Project: your Portfolio!
You‚Äôre going to create a Portfolio site showing off you and all the work that you‚Äôve done!</p>
<p>You can use your portfolio site for whatever you‚Äôd like - to try to attract clients for freelancing, or to try to attract employers, or even just a place for people to find out more about you.</p>
<p>It‚Äôd be good to have a ‚Äúprojects‚Äù section of your site, that includes the projects that you‚Äôve done in this class, as well as any other art, sound, music, video, writing, media, or code that you‚Äôve done - anything else that you‚Äôre proud of!</p>
<p>A couple notes
You can use whatever libraries you want! You don‚Äôt have to use Bootstrap themes (or even use Bootstrap at all!), but it would probably be pretty helpful as a starting point.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to use jQuery, but it might be helpful for dropdowns, modals, popovers and other hidden/shown elements. Chances are that you can use Bootstrap components for a lot of these things too.</p>
<p>Try to show off your other projects from this class! Your client project, your Lorem Ipsum app, and any other projects are great. Include a short writeup too!</p>
<p>What to submit
Assignments 17 &amp; 18: Submit a couple versions of your portfolio page.
Assignment 19 (the last assignment!): Submit the final version of your portfolio page.</p>
<p>Create a separate Firebase app to host your portfolio page, and keep it live after the class ends! We want to make sure that potential employers can see it.</p>
<p>The URL that you submit for Assignment 19 gets sent along with your report card.</p>
<p>Portfolio examples
(not all of these are good, but they should at least all be interesting. They‚Äôre friends‚Äô portfolios, or sites that were sent to me by friends)
