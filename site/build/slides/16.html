<p>More dumb fun web stuff
I‚Äôm not sure, but I think I know how this works:
<a href="http://xkcd.com/1663">http://xkcd.com/1663</a>
When you load the page, you get a fragment appended to the URL (a fragment is the # bit). This creates a new game, and sends some information off to the server, including unique info about your browser, so you can share a read-only URL with others. Every time you edit the page, it sends your edits to the server, and the server runs your garden continuously.
<a href="http://xkcd.com/1663/#55944f62-fa9b-11e5-8001-42010a8e0010">http://xkcd.com/1663/#55944f62-fa9b-11e5-8001-42010a8e0010</a>
When you load a URL that already has a fragment, it loads up that specific game, and the controls if you‚Äôre accessing it from the original browser.</p>
<p>Notes on the end of class
On April 27th at 8pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!
Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects (Client, Lorem Ipsum, and Portfolio)
Remember to check your grades with grades!
Remember to create separate firebase apps for your projects (and that they‚Äôre submitted to the grader for the right assignments), so that potential employers can see them!</p>
<p>Tonight
on Front End Web Development:</p>
<p>Advanced Topics: Back End Web Development with Node.js!</p>
<p>What is Node?
You know how we can run JavaScript in the browser?
We can also run JavaScript in Node.js!</p>
<p>Things look a little different between the two:
In the browser, you get some builtin variables/objects, like document and window
In Node, you get a whole different bunch of builtin variables/objects, like fs and require
Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine: gross details here</p>
<p>Using Node to run JavaScript
First, create a file named index.js</p>
<p>Then, add console.log(‚ÄúHello, this is running from Node.js!‚Äù); to your index.js</p>
<p>Finally, run node index.js</p>
<p>Marvel at your ultimate cosmic power!</p>
<p>What is Express?
We‚Äôll be using a library called express. (<a href="http://expressjs.com/">http://expressjs.com/</a>)</p>
<p>Express makes it easier to send and receive HTTP requests. It can turn Node.js into a web server!</p>
<p>(Any time we request a webpage, or send information to a server, we use something called an HTTP request - the two main types of HTTP requests are GET and POST.)</p>
<p>Install Express
Navigate to a new project folder!</p>
<p>Run:
npm init (then just hit enter a bunch)
npm install express --save</p>
<p>Note: while it will work without it, --save is required for deploying to Modulus (more on that later)</p>
<p>Including Express in our project
Inside index.js:</p>
<p>var express = require(‚Äúexpress‚Äù);</p>
<p>Run it again (node index.js), just to be sure that it‚Äôs right.</p>
<p>Telling express to be a web server!
var app = express();
// we‚Äôll put some other code here
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);</p>
<p>This tells express to start listening on port 3000 (or, whatever port Modulus assigns. More on Modulus later)
Run the script again - what happens on the command line?
(ctrl-C quits)</p>
<p>Receiving HTTP requests
Before app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000):</p>
<p>app.get(&quot;/&quot;, function(request, response) {
    console.log(&quot;hey! something happened!&quot;);
})</p>
<p>Restart your server (kill and rerun node index.js), then open a browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. What happens?</p>
<p>Sending data back in response
app.get(&quot;/&quot;, function(request, response) {
    console.log(&quot;hey! something happened!&quot;);
    response.send(&quot;client says what?&quot;);
})</p>
<p>Note that you have to restart your script every time!</p>
<p>Getting info from the URL
Add a second app.get call:</p>
<p>app.get(&quot;/hello/:name&quot;, function(request, response) {
    response.send(&quot;Hello, &quot; + request.params.name + &quot;!&quot;)
})</p>
<p>Restart, and go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/hello/yourname">http://localhost:3000/hello/yourname</a>. What happens?</p>
<p>Deploying to Modulus
We‚Äôre going to use Modulus to host our Node.js code. It‚Äôs a little like Firebase!</p>
<p><a href="https://modulus.io/">https://modulus.io/</a></p>
<p>Normally it‚Äôs not free, but they give you a $15 credit when you sign up, and they don‚Äôt require payment info.
That should be enough to host a tiny server full-time for 2 months - more than enough for what we‚Äôre doing in the class!</p>
<p>Install the Modulus command line tools:
npm install modulus -g</p>
<p>If you get an error with that, try:</p>
<p>sudo npm install modulus -g</p>
<p>Sign up for Modulus
Run modulus signup, and follow the prompts</p>
<p>(pretty cool that you can sign up from the command line, right?)</p>
<p>Create a new Modulus project
Navigate to your project folder, then run modulus project create.</p>
<p>Name it whatever you like!
When asked for the runtime, select Node.js.
When asked for the servo size, enter 192.</p>
<p>Deploy your Node.js app to Modulus
In your project folder, run modulus deploy, and confirm that you‚Äôre deploying the right app.
(then sit and wait for a minute or two)</p>
<p>Navigate to your app (something like <a href="http://yourappnamehere-12345.onmodulus.net">http://yourappnamehere-12345.onmodulus.net</a>) and check that everything is working as expected.</p>
<p>Marvel at your unlimited cosmic power!</p>
<p>Debugging Modulus
If your Modulus stuff isn‚Äôt working, try running modulus logs. It might give you a clue as to what‚Äôs broken!</p>
<p>Are you in the right directory?
Did you run npm init and npm install express --save in the right directory?
Did you run modulus deploy from the right directory?</p>
<p>Assignment 16
Create a tiny Node.js web server that‚Äôs accessible from the internet! (use Modulus!)</p>
<p>Your server needs to respond to ‚Äú/hello/world‚Äù with ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù
(it also needs to respond to other names, too!)</p>
