<p>Notes on the end of class
On April 27th at 8pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get sent to Arieann, for internship placement services.
Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects (Client, Lorem Ipsum, and Portfolio)
Remember to check your grades with grades!
Remember to create separate firebase apps for your projects (and that they‚Äôre submitted to the grader for the right assignments), so that potential employers can see them!</p>
<p>Internships?
You don‚Äôt have to do this right now, but if you‚Äôre interested, be sure to do it before April 27th at 8pm.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in Spark‚Äôs help with finding an internship, fill out this form, and select the ‚Äúseeking an internship‚Äù option! Fill out all the other stuff too.
<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/uhKBIJHhzU">http://goo.gl/forms/uhKBIJHhzU</a>
For each student, I usually send a short recommendation to Arieann (along with report cards). If you‚Äôre selected for internship placement services, she‚Äôll get in touch with you via email.</p>
<p>Get a job!
Usually get 5-10 leads a week through the CU CS jobs list!</p>

<p>Geekify wants a web developer intern from Spark?
A little bird (Danny) told me that <a href="http://geekifyinc.com/">http://geekifyinc.com/</a> is looking for a web developer intern from Spark!</p>
<p>(that‚Äôs literally all I know right now! we don‚Äôt have a job posting or link or anything)</p>
<p>(but, maybe some enterprising young web developer interns from Spark will figure out how to get in touch with them and ask them about it, and maybe even send them their portfolio and projects and stuff)</p>
<p>Google tour details
There are multiple Google buildings in Boulder!
We‚Äôre meeting in the lobby of the one on the SW corner of 26th and Pearl. (Google Bldg 2590)
Parking is available all around that building (2590), and any parking designated for Google is available for guests.
We‚Äôre meeting in that lobby at 11am on Monday, April 25th. Please be on time!
If you need a ride, please let us know! Coordinate in #general. I‚Äôm available to give rides, and other students may be too.</p>
<p>Tonight
on Front End Web Development:</p>
<p>Portfolios, part 3!
Our very last session :‚Äô(</p>
<p>What to submit
Assignments 17 &amp; 18: Submit a couple versions of your portfolio page.
Assignment 19: Submit the final version of your portfolio page.</p>
<p>Create a separate Firebase app to host your portfolio page, and keep it live after the class ends! We want to make sure that potential employers can see it.</p>
<p>The URL that you submit for assignment 19 gets sent along with your report card.</p>
<p>Anyone want to show off their portfolio?</p>
<p>You have until April 27th at 8pm to submit assignments!</p>
<p>(report cards get generated then)</p>
<p>What happens to the Slack after class ends?
The Slack is going to still be around, and I‚Äôll still be responsive on it!</p>
<p>I‚Äôll add everyone to an #alumni channel so that we still have a place to hang.</p>
<p>The summer class will start in June-ish, so you may want to leave the #general channel so you don‚Äôt get excess notifications.
I also might change the name/URL of the Slack to fit the new classes, but you‚Äôll still be able to access it.</p>
<p>What happens to the Syllabus after class ends?
The Syllabus is going to still be around at <a href="https://hoff.tech/classes/frontendwebdev">https://hoff.tech/classes/frontendwebdev</a>. All of the slides will stay up too.</p>
<p>However, I‚Äôm not sure what the long-term plan is for that URL.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôll reuse the URL for the summer classes. In any case, I‚Äôll make the syllabus easy enough to find somewhere on <a href="https://hoff.tech">https://hoff.tech</a>.</p>
<p>Future freelance/consulting/contract work
If you do freelance work for a client you‚Äôve never worked with before OR for a nontrivial amount of compensation (&gt;$500), I‚Äôd recommend signing a contract before beginning any real work.</p>
<p>Hofftech Standard Contract (I‚Äôm updating this all the time): <a href="https://gist.github.com/kenhoff/0f903b90be1c19b706ce66708292288a">https://gist.github.com/kenhoff/0f903b90be1c19b706ce66708292288a</a></p>
<p>Have them sign it using HelloSign (just copy the contract into a Google doc or something, and import it into HelloSign)</p>
<p>Obligatory Hofftech Pitch
If you ever need help with anything, let me know! Totally down to have a look at your code. (you obviously don‚Äôt need to pay me)</p>
<p>If you find someone that needs a web app built, let me know! I‚Äôd be happy to hire you on as a subcontractor so you can make some money and get some more experience.</p>
<p>(unlike IBM, I won‚Äôt take 80% of a $1.4 million contract and just dump the rest on you)</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been awesome having you guys! Stay in touch!
You can always, always reach me at ken@hoff.tech (or on Slack) for anything at all! Help with web dev stuff, job searching, news about your life, getting a beer to catch up, whatever! I love hearing about student life post-class.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll miss you all :‚Äô(</p>
