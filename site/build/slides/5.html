<p>Session 5: <strong>The Final Session</strong> (not really)</p>
<p>Client Project Kickoff: Working with Clients</p>

<p>I&#39;d still recommend doing the readings, if you can. I&#39;ll include lots of links to free, prebuilt HTML themes that are available for you to download and customize for your clients, so you don&#39;t have to build everything yourself!</p>
<p>And there is still an assignment. But it&#39;s easy. You can hate me later.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="client-projects-">Client projects!</h1>
<p>For assignment 9, you&#39;ll submit a site that you made for a client!</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve already got a client in mind, great!</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have a client yet, that&#39;s alright! You can get a list of some potential clients by having a look at <code>readings 9</code>. Keep checking it - I add more people every so often!</p>
<p>During session 9, you can present your client project if you want!</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="client-project-faq">Client project FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Do they <em>have</em> to pay me?</strong></p>
<p>A: Nope! They don&#39;t have to. Part of the class work and all.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are they <em>allowed</em> to pay me?</strong></p>
<p>A: Of course! <em>(but make sure it&#39;s a small amount, otherwise you&#39;ll have to sign paperwork and stuff)</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I can&#39;t get it done in time for session 9?</strong></p>
<p>A: That&#39;s okay! Just be sure to get it done by the end of the course. The URL you submit is included as part of your report card!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does the client have to use what I make?</strong></p>
<p>A: Nope - the client is under no obligation to publicly use your work. If they would like to, they totally can!</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="how-to-find-clients">How to find clients</h1>
<p>For this class, you&#39;ve either already got a client or will get in touch with someone on the list (remember, <code>readings 9</code> to get the list of clients) about their page. Hooray!</p>
<p>This advice mostly applies to people who are interested in doing freelance/consulting work, or would like to run a freelance/consulting shop.</p>
<p>To land clients in real life, you need to do 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a sales funnel/pipeline</li>
<li>Get clients into the funnel/pipeline</li>
<li>Move clients through the funnel/pipeline</li>
</ol>
<p>In non-business-y terms, this equates to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep track of all the potential clients that you talk to (<a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> is great!)</li>
<li>Talk to potential clients (go out and network, talk to every single person that you know and say that you&#39;re looking for work, hand out business cards)</li>
<li>Actually do web development for clients</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="how-to-work-with-a-client">How to work with a client</h1>
<ol>
<li>Meet with the client, gather requirements and feedback</li>
<li>Build something</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="step-1-meet-with-the-client-gather-requirements-and-feedback">Step 1: Meet with the client, gather requirements and feedback</h1>
<p>First, arrange a meeting with your client - face-to-face is best, but video chat should be fine. You can set up a phone call as a last resort, but you won&#39;t be able to read body language or emotion as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Absolute easiest video chat software is <a href="http://appear.in/">http://appear.in/</a>, but Hangouts and Skype work too.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meeting, you want to find out a couple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out what they&#39;re currently using as a web presence. Facebook page? Twitter? Tumblr? Wordpress? What do they like about it, and what don&#39;t they like about it?</li>
<li>What do they want their web presence to accomplish? To show people dates and times? Menus? Portfolio projects? Who is their site for? Customers? Potential employers?</li>
<li>What other sites do they like or are inspired by? There&#39;s lots of great reference material from similar businesses, competitors or freelancers.</li>
</ol>
<p>These kinds of questions help determine what kind of content, layout, and styling you should use.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="step-2-build-something">Step 2: Build something</h1>
<p>Start small! Get to something demoable ASAP. Deploy a draft on Firebase, so that you&#39;ve got something the client can take a look at as you go.</p>
<p>Placeholder images, text, all totally fine. You&#39;ll iterate on this as you go.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="step-3-repeat">Step 3: Repeat</h1>
<p>It&#39;s scary as shit showing off something that you&#39;ve made - it&#39;s gonna feel half-assed, and look kinda lumpy, and it&#39;s probably held together with popsicle sticks and glue, but show it to your client anyway.</p>
<p>Your client will like some stuff and not like other stuff. <strong>Take notes!</strong></p>
<p>Now you&#39;ve got some concrete, tangible feedback on a concrete, tangible site - go improve it, and do it all over again!</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="things-that-you-will-probably-be-able-to-do">Things that you will probably be able to do</h1>
<p><strong>Landing pages</strong> - pages with one or two sections. Mostly consist of links to other sites.</p>
<p><strong>Single-page sites</strong> - pages with several sections. Consist of info, modals, links, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-page sites</strong> - several different pages, each with one or two sections of dedicated info. Main page has links to other sites, and other pages may have links too.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="things-that-might-be-too-much-work">Things that might be too much work</h1>
<p><strong>Blogs &amp; product pages</strong> - these are generally updated pretty frequently. I&#39;d stick with links to Medium or Shopify.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping carts, checkouts</strong> - This requires significant backend coding. If they need something like that, I&#39;d recommend Shopify.</p>
<p><strong>Contact forms</strong> - also requires some backend coding; e.g. a server to actually manage and send emails. Stick to links to social media.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="assets-that-you-will-need-from-your-client">Assets that you will need from your client</h1>
<p><strong>Images</strong> - product images, team photos (group and individual), background images, office images</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong> - Slogans, product descriptions, customer testimonials</p>
<p><strong>Links to social media</strong> - Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Medium, Instagram</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="embeds">Embeds</h1>
<p>Embeddable elements can make your life easier!</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Calendar (<a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en">https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en</a>)</li>
<li>Twitter timelines (<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines">https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines</a>)</li>
<li>YouTube videos (<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>They usually have some options to customize them - poke around in the documentation!</p>
<p>Google around to find other things that you can embed.</p>
<p>If you want to embed something specific, and they don&#39;t have embeddable elements, then you might be able to use <a href="http://embed.ly/">http://embed.ly/</a> to do it. Ask me if you need help.</p>
</section><section class="slide">
<h1 id="setting-up-your-firebase-app-with-a-custom-url">Setting up your Firebase app with a custom URL</h1>
<ol>
<li>Buy a domain (I usually use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>)</li>
<li>Go to the &quot;Hosting&quot; section on the Firebase app console</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Connect Custom Domain&quot; button</li>
<li>Add your domain (just <code>my-domain-name.com</code> - no <code>http</code> or <code>www</code>)</li>
<li>To &quot;verify ownership&quot;, head into your Namecheap dashboard, and click &quot;Manage&quot; on the domain that you&#39;re trying to connect.</li>
<li>Find the &quot;Host records&quot; section on the dashboard for your domain.</li>
<li>Create two <code>TXT</code> records, each with the value specified in the Firebase popup.</li>
<li>While you wait for Firebase to validate the domain, sit back, relax, and watch some <a href="https://youtu.be/9C_HReR_McQ">Don&#39;t Hug Me I&#39;m Scared</a>.</li>
<li>Reconsider every life decision that you have ever made.</li>
<li>Once Firebase has validated the domain, head back into the Namecheap host records for your domain.</li>
<li>Add the <code>CNAME</code> host records specified in the Firebase popup.</li>
<li>Test out your domain to see if it works!</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="what-to-submit-for-assignment-5">What to submit for assignment 5</h1>
<p>For assignment 5, I want you to submit a link to your client&#39;s existing site or web presence. This just gives us an idea of who your client is, and what life was like before you came in blew their minds!</p>
<p>If they don&#39;t already have a site, just submit anything that you can find on them - Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, anything that tells us a little bit about them.</p>
<p>For example, if I was doing some work for my friend Josh, I&#39;d submit this to @classbot:</p>
<pre><code>submit 5 https://soundcloud.com/joshuaduchene
