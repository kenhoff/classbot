# Assignment 8

Flexbox & media queries

For this assignment, I'd like for you to create several elements that have various `flex`-related styles. **Remember, the only way to find out which styles you need is to submit the assignment!**

I actually don't have a way to test media queries, so I'll have to let you know if that changes. In the meantime, don't worry about writing any media queries.

Create a new page `assignment8.html` on your site44 site and run `submit 8 my-site44-site.site44.com/assignment8.html`.

Happy styling!
