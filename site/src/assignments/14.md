# Assignment 14

For this project, you're gonna play the role of IBM, and I'm gonna play the role of the TSA.

**I need a web app that, when you hit a button (or press a key), creates an arrow pointing left or right.**

If you'd like, you can model it after https://tsa-randomizer.hoff.tech/ - but if you just copy-paste, that's a *Bad Thing*.

Submit your version of the app for assignment 14, using `submit 14 your-tsa-randomizer-app.firebaseapp.com`. Remember to create a separate Firebase project for it, and keep it up after the class ends!

For more info on the project, check out `readings 14`.
