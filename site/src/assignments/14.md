## Project 3: Coin Flipping App

For your third project, I'd like you to create an app that flips a coin and records the results!

I'd like for you to create a page with two buttons: "Flip coin" and "Reset". Every time you click the "Flip coin" button, your page writes either a "Heads" or "Tails" to the page. Every time you click the "Flip coin" button, the old results stick around, so eventually you'll have a big long list of "Heads" and "Tails".

If you click the "Reset" button, it should clear out all the previous results, and allow you to click the "Flip coin" button for more results.

I should also mention, there should be a 50/50 chance for heads/tails :)

A couple things:

-   For [assignment 14](/assignments/14) (this assignment!), you'll submit a link to your Coin Flipping App. That means that you'll just run `submit 14 http://my-awesome-coin-flipping-app.site44.com/index.html` on @classbot.
-   Whatever URL you submit, please try to keep that live for as long as possible, during and after the class. It gets included on your report card, and it's nice to be able to show it to potential employers and clients.
-   If you'd like to present your progress, you can do so on Session 14. Presenting is totally optional!
