# Assignment 2

For this assignment, create a page with some specific HTML elements on it.

**There's only one way to find out exactly what tags you need: submit the assignment!**

It's completely fine to submit a completely blank site, and then continue resubmitting it as you complete the requirements.

First, create a site on Firebase (or, you can use an existing one).

Then, submit the assignment by running `submit 2 my-awesome-site.firebaseapp.com`.

Have a look at all of the tests that were run - the ones with green checkmarks passed, and the ones with red X's failed. **Be sure to click on the "Show more" link!**

Update your site, redeploy, and submit again!

_(Instead of giving you all the tags you need right away, we use this method to encourage you to be iterative. We want you to submit the smallest possible solution, and iterate on it until you've got 100%. Hooray!)_
