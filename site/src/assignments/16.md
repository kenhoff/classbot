# Assignment 16

## jQuery 202: jQuery advanced methods, HTTP requests with jQuery - Part 1

For this assignment, I'm going to have you create some functions that use jQuery to select/manipulate various HTML tags on the page.

The only way for you to find out exactly what functions you need to create is to submit the assignment!

Create a separate page for this assignment, like `assignment16.html`, and submit it by running `submit 16 http://your-site44-site.site44.com/assignment16.html`.
