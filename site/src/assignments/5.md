# Assignment 5

For this assignment, submit a link to your client's existing site or web presence. This just gives us an idea of who your client is, and what life was like before you came in blew their minds!

If they don't already have a site, just submit anything that you can find on them - Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, anything that tells us a little bit about them.

For example, if I was doing some work for my friend Josh, I'd submit this:
