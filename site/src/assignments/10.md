# Assignment 10

For this assignment, I'd like for you to create a page with some `<script>` tags on it! You'll include some `alert()` and `console.log()` commands on there too. See what you need by running `submit 10 http://your-site-here.firebaseapp.com`.

_Note: I haven't included any requirements to `document.write()` anything on your page (it's surprisingly hard to check for that!) but I'd recommend that you do it anyway._
