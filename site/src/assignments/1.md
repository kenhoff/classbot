# Assignment 1

For your first real web dev assignment, I'd like you to create a super simple page and host it online using Firebase. (you can host it anywhere you like, but Firebase is the easiest - look at the `readings`!)

Your page should contain this code:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

Submit your page by running `submit 1 my-firebase-app.firebaseapp.com`.
