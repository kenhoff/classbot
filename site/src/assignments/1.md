# Assignment 1

For your first real web dev assignment, I'd like you to create a super simple page and host it online using site44. (you can host it anywhere you like, but site44 is the easiest - [look at the slides](/slides/1)!)

Your page should contain this code:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

Submit your page by running `submit 1 my-site44-app.site44.com` on @classbot.

If you created a separate page for this assignment (e.g., if your filename is `assignment1.html` instead of `index.html`), then you'll need to submit something like `submit 1 my-site44-app.site44.com/assignment1.html`
