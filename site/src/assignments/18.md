# Assignment 18

## Advanced Topics: Back End Web Development with Node.js

For this assignment, I'm going to have you create a Node.js server (hosted on [Gomix](https://gomix.com/)) that responds differently based on what URL is requested.

The only way for you to find out exactly what URLs you need to respond to is to submit the assignment!

Create a separate page for this assignment, like `assignment18.html`, and submit it by running `submit 18 https://your-gomix-app.gomix.me/`.
