# Assignment 17

## jQuery 203: HTTP requests with jQuery - Part 2

For this assignment, I'm going to have you create some functions that use jQuery to make some HTTP requests to the old Random Quote App API.

You don't need to worry about actually doing anything with the data, or submitting any new data to the API - just make the requests.

The only way for you to find out exactly what functions you need to create is to submit the assignment!

Create a separate page for this assignment, like `assignment17.html`, and submit it by running `submit 17 http://your-site44-site.site44.com/assignment17.html`.
