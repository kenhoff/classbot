## SFEWDSSS

I'm going to have you create the front end of a very simple **social media site**. We'll call it the "Spark Front End Web Development Student Social Site", or SFEWDSSS for short.

Your site should have **two pages**.

The first page should be your **news feed**. Every time someone goes to it, they'll be able to see all of the most recent posts by everyone on the SFEWDSSS. I'd recommend that this is your `index.html`, so that whenever people go to `http://kens-super-social-media-site.site44.com/` they'll see the main page.

The second page should be your **posting page**. It will allow you to create new posts on the SFEWDSSS. It should be a **secret**! Don't include a link to it on your main page. Only you should know which page you should go to in order to create a new post. Your URL for this page will probably be something like `http://kens-super-social-media-site.site44.com/kens-super-secret-posting-page.html`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# but wait...don't these kinds of sites require a backend?

That's correct! That's why I'm going to build one for you. (It's not done yet, but I'll get it done next week sometime.)

Generally, big social media sites like these require you to be able to log in, and edit your profile, and all sorts of complicated backend stuff. This isn't backend web dev, so I'm not going to make any of you do that!

In the coming week here, I'm going to post a site somewhere that includes an **API** for our social media site. I'll provide you a couple URLs that you'll make **requests** to in order to get and create posts on SFEWDSSS.

I'll post an official project description later this week, and we'll jump right into it as soon as we're back from break!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# That's all I've got for today!

What questions are there?

# How to be a Web Developer

1.  Look stuff up on the internet
2.  Make stuff
3.  Repeat

# Appendix

# Note - these slides are from last semester. Last time I had students put together a "Random Quote App" for their final project, that would pull random quotes from a database, and allow people to post new quotes to the database. I'm going to be taking it in a different direction this semester. If you'd still like to work on this project, go for it! Everything should still be working, just message me if not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The last project: a Random Quote App

I'm going to have you build an app that displays a random quote whenever you visit the page!

Your Random Quote App must do three things:

-   When a user comes to the page, it displays a quote, pulled at random from a list of quotes
-   A user can click a button to get a new quote, pulled at random from a list of quotes
-   **A user can fill out a text box and submit a new quote to be included in the list of quotes**

You don't have all the information that you need to complete this project yet! That's okay, because we'll be learning jQuery and how to communicate with servers over the next 5 sessions.

Submit your Random Quote App as assignment 19. You can also get this information with `readings 19`. Remember to keep the site live after the class ends, so that potential employers and clients can see it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# But wait - you need a "backend" for the Random Quote App!

So I built one for you! `randomquote` is a REST API that allows you to retrieve quotes from lists of quotes, and add new quotes to lists of quotes.

Documentation is available at <http://randomquote.hoff.tech>.

For this project, you'll only need to do two main things:

-   Retrieve a random quote from a list of quotes
-   Add a new quote to a list of quotes

(but, the API provides many more functions than that! Feel free to use them)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Rules of the API

The API is **unauthenticated**. This means that **anyone** can get any data or post any data into this database.

Things you **should** do:

-   Send test data! (Post a quote with the text "asdf" and see what happens)
-   Handle what happens when a list of quotes doesn't have any quotes in it
-   Be patient - because this is running for free on Heroku, it sometimes takes a little bit to wake up if nobody's used it for a while
-   Tell Ken if there's ever a problem with the API!

Things you **should not** do:

-   Post 1000 test quotes, then leave them there. I only get so much room on this database, don't abuse it. If you need to load-test this stuff, make sure you're cleaning up your data. Use the API.
-   Store secure or sensitive data, up to but not including, passwords, SSNs, or credit card numbers.
-   DDOS the API. Duh.
-   Post the information about the API widely and publicly. It's fine to show it to your friends!
