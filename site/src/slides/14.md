Recently, in web dev news:
(okay this isnâ€™t strictly web dev, but the principles are the same)

https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/tsa-randomizer-app-cost-336000/
An iPad app that consists of an arrow randomly pointing left or right cost the TSA $336,000
Can you make a website that consists of an arrow randomly pointing left or right? If so, the TSA might pay you $336,000

More dumb fun web stuff
XKCDâ€™s Simple Writer

http://xkcd.com/simplewriter/

A box for writing words where you can only use the ten hundred words that people use the most often.

Tonight
on Front End Web Development:


Lorem Ipsum App!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it
Make a Lorem Ipsum generator.

Your Lorem Ipsum generator will need:
A theme (Hipster, DJ Khaled, Hodor, Yeezy, Samuel L Jackson, anything goes!)
An input for the number of paragraphs desired
A button that generates the Lorem Ipsum, and puts it into an HTML element so that users can copy it
Some style

What to submit
Assignment 14: Submit the subject/theme of your Lorem Ipsum generator. No need to build anything yet!
Example: submit 14 https://www.daftpunk.com/

Assignment 15: Submit your final, complete Lorem Ipsum generator.
Example: submit 15 https://harderbetterfasteripsum.hoff.tech/

I havenâ€™t explicitly taught you everything you need to know in order to create your Lorem Ipsum generator.
For example:
Input elements
Reading the value of input elements
Selecting random elements from arrays
Concatenating strings
