XKCD’s Simple Writer

http://xkcd.com/simplewriter/

A box for writing words where you can only use the ten hundred words that people use the most often.

Tonight
on Front End Web Development:


Lorem Ipsum App!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it
Make a Lorem Ipsum generator.

Your Lorem Ipsum generator will need:
A theme (Hipster, DJ Khaled, Hodor, Yeezy, Samuel L Jackson, anything goes!)
An input for the number of paragraphs desired
A button that generates the Lorem Ipsum, and puts it into an HTML element so that users can copy it
Some style

What to submit
Assignment 14: Submit the subject/theme of your Lorem Ipsum generator. No need to build anything yet!
Example: submit 14 https://www.daftpunk.com/

Assignment 15: Submit your final, complete Lorem Ipsum generator.
Example: submit 15 https://harderbetterfasteripsum.hoff.tech/

I haven’t explicitly taught you everything you need to know in order to create your Lorem Ipsum generator.
For example:
Input elements
Reading the value of input elements
Selecting random elements from arrays
Concatenating strings

Side note - the one developer I look up to the most is Zach Holman.
All of the stuff that he’s got on his blog is worth reading - highly recommend checking it out.
