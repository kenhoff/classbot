# Projects!

Over the course of the next 10 weeks, I'm going to have you complete 4 different projects.

You can present your project to the class, if you want! Definitely not required.

Just like all of the other assignments, these aren't formally "due" anytime.

These projects won't be formally graded at all, but they'll be included in your "report card" at the end of the class. They're also really cool to show off to potential clients and employers!

## Project 1: Your Portfolio Page - Session 4

This one can be super simple to start! The expectation is that you'll build on it over time to include all of your projects and other work that you're proud of.

## Project 2: Client Project - Session 9

You'll find a client (local business, friend, or family) and build a simple site for them. Something simple, like a visual artist's portfolio or a restaurant's site. If you've got someone in mind already, great! If not, no problem at all! I've got a list of people who would be interested in having a site built for them.

## Project 3: TSA Randomizer - Session 14

Details to come!

## Project 4: Random Quote App - Session 19

Details to come!

# Tonight, on Front End Web Development...

-   Hosting our site on Site44
-   Debugging our site
-   More HTML tags

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hosting our site on Site44

This whole flow may look slightly different when you sign up for the first time - at some point in the process Site44 will ask to access your Dropbox, and you should allow it access.

-   Log into Site44, and go to your admin page (<https://www.site44.com/admin>)
-   Create a new website -> Use a site44.com domain -> Name your website -> Create
-   Check your Dropbox - inside, it should have a folder in `/Dropbox/Apps/site44/yoursitenamehere.site44.com`
-   Open up `index.html` (the one inside the Dropbox site44 folder) in Atom
-   Delete everything in there, and replace it with this:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

-   Double click the `index.html` file in your Dropbox so that it opens in your browser, and check the URL. It should say something like `file:///Users/ken/Dropbox/Apps/site44/yoursitenamehere.site44.com/index.html`.
    -   This is the file that's on your local machine. Nothing on the internet here!
-   Open a new browser tab and navigate to `yoursitenamehere.site44.com`. You should see the exact same page.
    -   This is hosted on the internet! Post it to the class Slack, or send it to your parents to show them how much you've accomplished so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Multiple pages on the same site, and why `index.html` is special

You can have multiple pages on the same site, but you have to specify which file you want in the URL.

For example, you can have an `about.html` page, but then you'll need to go to <http://notajetski.site44.com/about.html> instead of just <http://notajetski.site44.com/>.

Or, `contact.html` -> <http://notajetski.site44.com/contact.html>

## `index.html`

Way back in the dark beginnings of the internet, you would connect to a web server (a site) and browse all of the files that they had.

You needed to know what files there were on the server, so by default, the server sent back a file `index.html` which contained a list of all of the files on the server.

![](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/images/directory-index.png)

Because it was basically default to want the `index.html` when you connected to a server, servers started sending `index.html` when the client didn't request a specific file.

This means that both of these URLs:

-   <http://notajetski.site44.com/>
-   <http://notajetski.site44.com/index.html>

will serve the exact same file (`index.html`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Debugging your site: Chrome's Developer tools

Firefox and Safari both have their own versions of this - they might look a little bit different, but you should be able to accomplish the same things.

There's a couple ways to access developer tools:

1.  Hamburger Menu > Other Tools > Developer Tools
2.  View > Developer > Developer Tools
3.  `‚åò-opt-I` (or `ctrl-opt-I` if you're on a PC)

Poke around with the developer tools, see what's there! There's a lot of interesting stuff, like the page "source" (the code behind the page), tools to track web requests and CPU usage, and a console for JavaScript.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Inspecting elements

There's a couple ways to inspect an element:

1.  Right-click an element on the page > Inspect
2.  Click the upper-left button in the Developer tools pane
3.  `‚åò-shift-C` (or `ctrl-shift-C` if you're on a PC)

Once you've selected an element, check out the "Styles" pane inside of Developer tools, and see what's going on there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# HTML tags

We already learned that we can use HTML tags to create HTML elements, and we need both an opening and closing tag for each HTML element.

Remember: HTML elements can be nested! You can put HTML elements inside of other HTML elements.

## Paragraph HTML tags

We saw paragraph tags last time. They're literally what they sound like - just an easy way to separate out a couple of paragraphs of content.

```html
<p>
	Lose yourself to dance digital love nightvision, ph≈ìnix. Alive, veridis quo voyager. Motherboard, face to face, technologic giorgio by moroder, too long. Fragments of time. Harder, better, faster, stronger, within daftendirekt, da funk rock'n roll on/off. Make love high life human after all. Television rules the nation fragments of time.
</p>
<p>
	Beyond steam machine daftendirekt, human after all, rock'n roll, within get lucky. Veridis quo robot rock, contact WDPK 83.7 FM indo silver club one more time. Contact. Make love. Steam machine superheroes. One more time around the world burnin' da funk. Lose yourself to dance robot rock, high life. Get lucky.
</p>
<p>
	Rock'n roll nightvision lose yourself to dance technologic. Lose yourself to dance crescendolls digital love giorgio by moroder veridis quo high fidelity lose yourself to dance rock'n roll superheroes motherboard touch touch, beyond. Nightvision the prime time of your life da funk. Homework. Emotion rollin' and scratchin', da funk motherboard.
</p>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Heading HTML tags

We also saw an `h1` "Heading" element last time. Headings are a good way to provide "titles" for different sections of a page.

You can have headings of different levels of importance, from `h1` (most important) to `h6` (least important).

```html
<h1>Around the World</h1>
<h2>Around the World</h2>
<h3>Around the World</h3>
<h4>Around the World</h4>
<h5>Around the World</h5>
<h6>Around the World</h6>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# List HTML tags

We can put lists of elements on the page, in a numbered (ordered) and bullet point (unordered) format.

First, you need to decide if you want an **ordered** (`<ol>`) or **unordered** (`<ul>`) list. Then, you put some **list items** (`<li>`) inside of the list tags.

```html
<h1>How to be a web developer</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Look stuff up on the internet</li>
	<li>Make stuff</li>
	<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>

<h1>Ken's shopping list</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Milk</li>
	<li>Eggs</li>
	<li>Absurd amounts of peanut butter</li>
</ul>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `strong` and `em` HTML tags

```html
<p>
	Never accept the world as it <em>appears</em> to be.
	Dare to see it for what it <strong>could</strong> be.
</p>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What questions are there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# That's all I've got!

Now, with our remaining time, you can work on your "About Me" page, work on the assignment for tonight, or mess around with more HTML tags!

-   `<img>` ‚Üê an image that's in the same folder as your page
-   `<img>` ‚Üê an image somewhere on the internet (but not in the same folder!)
-   `<br>`
-   `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
-   `<title>`
-   `<div>`, `<span>`
-   `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` (try opening your page on your phone, and then adding/removing this tag)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Stuff for tonight:

-   Complete [assignment 1](/assignments/1)
    -   I'd recommend creating separate pages for each assignment, and then just submitting that specific page (e.g. `submit 1 http://notajetski.site44.com/assignment1.html`)
-   Complete [readings 2](/readings/2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to be a Web Developer

-   Look stuff up on the internet
-   Make stuff
-   Repeat

# "File system" or "File structure"

Files and folders are represented as a **tree** on your computer.

"directory" == "folder"

`/` - is the "root" of your file system. The absolute top-most directory of your hard drive

`/Users/ken/Documents` - a directory where I keep all my documents!

`/Users` - all the users on my computer

`/Users/ken` - all the things that I (ken) own (are there other users?)

`/Users/ken/dev` - where I keep all of my development-related directories

(for Windows or Linux, this will look a bit different)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Command line stuff

Open a terminal and try some commands:

`ls`

`cd`

`pwd`

`mkdir`

what about with "arguments"?

~

`/`

`..`

`.`

`/Users/ken/dev`

what's a "flag"?
