# Projects!

Over the course of the next 10 weeks, I'm going to have you complete 4 different projects.

You can present your project to the class, if you want! Definitely not required.

Just like all of the other assignments, these aren't formally "due" anytime.

These projects won't be formally graded at all, but they'll be included in your "report card" at the end of the class. They're also really cool to show off to potential clients and employers!

## Project 1: Your Portfolio Page - Session 4

> This one can be super simple to start! The expectation is that you'll build on it over time to include all of your projects and other work that you're proud of.

## Project 2: Client Project - Session 9

> You'll find a client (local business, friend, or family) and build a simple site for them. Something simple, like a visual artist's portfolio or a restaurant's site. If you've got someone in mind already, great! If not, no problem at all! I've got a list of people who would be interested in having a site built for them.

## Project 3: TSA Randomizer - Session 14

> Ever played with <http://hackertyper.com/?> Now you have!
>
> Build something pretty similar to this - you can pretend to be coding the matrix, or writing the complete works of lovecraft, or even just mushing together every Kanye quote you can find and calling it a work of genius.

## Project 4: Random Quote App - Session 19

> Pretty simple on the surface - just display a random quote of the day. The complicated part of this is that the specific quote actually comes from a server, not the client-side page.

# Debugging your site: Chrome's Developer tools

Firefox and Safari both have their own versions of this - they might look a little bit different, but you should be able to accomplish the same things.

There's a couple ways to access developer tools:

1.  Hamburger Menu > Other Tools > Developer Tools
2.  View > Developer > Developer Tools
3.  `‚åò-opt-I` (or `ctrl-opt-I` if you're on a PC)

Poke around with the developer tools, see what's there! There's a lot of interesting stuff, like the page "source" (the code behind the page), tools to track web requests and CPU usage, and a console for JavaScript.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Inspecting elements

There's a couple ways to inspect an element:

1.  Right-click an element on the page > Inspect
2.  Click the upper-left button in the Developer tools pane
3.  `‚åò-shift-C` (or `ctrl-shift-C` if you're on a PC)

Once you've selected an element, check out the "Styles" pane inside of Developer tools, and see what's going on there.

# "File system" or "File structure"

Files and folders are represented as a **tree** on your computer.

"directory" == "folder"

`/` - is the "root" of your file system. The absolute top-most directory of your hard drive

`/Users/ken/Documents` - a directory where I keep all my documents!

`/Users` - all the users on my computer

`/Users/ken` - all the things that I (ken) own (are there other users?)

`/Users/ken/dev` - where I keep all of my development-related directories

(for Windows or Linux, this will look a bit different)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Command line stuff

Open a terminal and try some commands:

`ls`

`cd`

`pwd`

`mkdir`

what about with "arguments"?

~

`/`

`..`

`.`

`/Users/ken/dev`

what's a "flag"?
