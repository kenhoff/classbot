# There's a bug in Assignment 3

For some reason, I can't get @classbot to pick up on `border-color`.

I'll let you know if I'm able to get that fixed, but I might just remove it.

I'll let everyone know either way on Slack!

Once I do, just rerun your submission.

# Spring 2016 class postmortem

I recently finished a postmortem on the Spring 2016 class! Check it out if you want: <https://hoff.tech/posts/2016/06/26/spark-class-spring-2016-postmortem>

# No class on July 4th!

I'd still recommend doing the readings, if you can. I'll include lots of links to free, prebuilt HTML themes that are available for you to download and customize for your clients, so you don't have to build everything yourself!

# Anyone want to show off their portfolio site?

I've had mine for a while, but I update it every so often: <https://hoff.tech/>

# Reminder: keep that separate Firebase live!

Create a separate Firebase for your Portfolio Site, and keep it live after the class ends! You want to be able to show this off to potential employers and clients.

# Setting up your Firebase app with a custom URL

1. Buy a domain (I usually use [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/))
2. Go to the "Hosting" section on the Firebase app console
3. Click the "Connect Custom Domain" button
4. Add your domain (just `my-domain-name.com` - no `http` or `www`)
5. To "verify ownership", head into your Namecheap dashboard, and click "Manage" on the domain that you're trying to connect.
6. Find the "Host records" section on the dashboard for your domain.
7. Create two `TXT` records, each with the value specified in the Firebase popup.
8. While you wait for Firebase to validate the domain, sit back, relax, and watch some [Don't Hug Me I'm Scared](https://youtu.be/9C_HReR_McQ).
9. Reconsider every life decision that you have ever made.
10. Once Firebase has validated the domain, head back into the Namecheap host records for your domain.
11. Add the `CNAME` host records specified in the Firebase popup.
12. Test out your domain to see if it works!
