# Makeup sessions

Because CU students have finals (boo!) and Fall Break (yay!), we try not to have class during those weeks!

So, we need to schedule two makeup class sessions.

Check the Slack, and vote on the time that generally works the best for you: <https://sparkfrontendwebdev.slack.com/archives/general/p1476732084000035>

Once we get a good list of times, I'll throw down some good dates

# Assignment 3 bugs D:

-   heights and widths should be in pixels (`px`)
-   colors should be using a hex format (`#7FFF00`)
-   If `margin`/`border`/`padding`/`height`/`width` isn't registering, try setting it to `0px` - sometimes that fixes it

## Bugs, y u do dis? :C

@classbot uses a library called [JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) (stands for JavaScript Document Object Model) to take in HTML, grab additional links to CSS and JavaScript, then render all of that stuff into a fake browser.

As part of this rendering process, the browser creates a "render tree", which takes all the styles for a every element and puts them together. If there are conflicting (overwriting) styles for a single element, it uses CSS specificity rules to pick the correct one.

From what I can tell, sometimes JSDOM doesn't quiiite get it right :c

Want to see some hardcore advanced web dev knowledge on the topic? Check out the [Render-tree Construction, Layout, and Paint](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/render-tree-construction) topic on [Google's Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/) site.

# Project 2: Client Project

For your second project, I'd like you to work with a client to build something web-dev related for them!

The scope of your project is really up to you. I'd recommend building some kind of landing page or marketing site for the client - HTML, CSS, text, images, links, everything.

If the client wants you to improve on an _existing_ site, it's _possible_, but I'd be careful - monkeying around with prepackaged Wordpress/Squarespace themes is a pretty easy way to get a headache.

If you've already got a client, great! If you need a client, I'd recommend first reaching out to @dannywalsh on Slack, and if you still can't find anyone, you can try emailing some of the folks listed on [readings 9](/readings/9).

A couple things:

-   For [assignment 5](/assignments/5), you'll submit a link to your client's existing web presence. This is just something to help us understand who your client is. If they don't have an existing web presence, just submit a link to their Facebook, Twitter, or even Google Maps location.
-   For [assignment 9](/assignments/9) (this assignment!), you'll submit a link to whatever you created for the client. That means that you'll just run `submit 9 http://my-awesome-client-project.site44.com/index.html` on @classbot.
-   Whatever URL you submit, please try to keep that live for as long as possible, during and after the class. It gets included on your report card, and it's nice to be able to show it to potential employers and clients.
-   If you'd like to present your progress, you can do so on Session 9. Presenting is totally optional!

## FAQ

**Q: Do they have to pay me?**

A: Nope! They don't have to. Part of the class work and all.

**Q: Are they allowed to pay me?**

A: Of course! (but make sure it's a small amount, otherwise you'll have to sign paperwork and stuff)

**Q: What if I can't get it done in time for session 9?**

A: I don't expect this to be completely done by Session 9! Your clients will likely be finnicky and temperamental, and delays in projects happen. Submit your site whenever it's all done, hopefully by the end of the class.

**Q: Does the client have to use what I make?**

A: Nope - the client is under no obligation to publicly use your work. If they would like to, they totally can!

# Anyone want to show off their portfolio site?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reminder: keep that site44 site live!

You might want to create a separate site44 site for your portfolio site, and keep it live after the class ends! You want to be able to show this off to potential employers and clients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setting up your site44 site with a custom URL

1.  Buy a domain (I usually use [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/))
2.  Go into your Namecheap dashboard, and click "Manage" on the domain that you're trying to connect.
3.  Head into the "Advanced DNS" section, and find the "Host records" section.
4.  Add new record -> CNAME record
    5.  Host: www
    6.  Target: domains.site44.com
    7.  Hit the checkbox to save
5.  Head back to site44, and create a new site with your own domain.
    6.  Instead of using a site44.com domain, put the name of your site (www.your-site-name-here.com) in the "Use your own domain" section, and click create.
    7.  It might not validate right away! The internet is slow sometimes.
6.  Once it validates and you create the new site, copy all your files into your new dropbox folder.
7.  Marvel at the vastness of your ultimate cosmic power!

# The next 5 sessions

The next session we have will cover **Working with Clients**. It's important to get this done early, so that you're comfortable working with clients.

The other 4 sessions we will learn about **page layout with CSS**.

# The 2 things you need to know to lay stuff out on a page

1.  Every single page on the internet is just a series of nested boxes.
2.  You should(\*) use flexbox to lay out all of your nested boxes.

> _\*: of course, there are plenty of caveats that we'll get into_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Every single page on the internet is just a series of nested boxes.

We've already sort of figured this out - there's an `html` element, and then a `body` element, and then a bunch more elements, all nested within each other.

Each element is a box. It has `height`, `width`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.

This is called the [CSS box model](https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/).

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/thebox.png)

You can check out the CSS box model on an element in Chrome's developer tools by looking for this thing:

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/firebox.png)

`padding` pushes the content away from the border, and `margin` pushes the element away from other elements. More on this in session 6, but that should get you started!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# You should(\*) use flexbox to lay out all of your nested boxes.

-   There are many ways to lay out something on a page. Treehouse will teach you about `float`s and grid systems. Grid systems are pretty good, but I think that flexbox is the right-_est_ way to lay out your page.
-   This is my highly subjective opinion! At this point, flexbox is considered a pretty stable feature, but web developers will argue about anything.
-   The problem: **flexbox still has some bugs on IE11, and does not work at all on IE8 or below.** (Edge is fine.)
    -   If you're "targeting" IE11, you might need to add additional styles, and there are still some bugs when using advanced flexbox features.
    -   If your users are running corporately-secured IE8 on oil rigs or something, flexbox will not work at all, and your site probably won't display correctly.
    -   [Here's a list of browsers and versions that support flexbox.](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

# Flexbox basics

-   The best flexbox cheatsheet out there:  <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/>
-   You can make any element into a **flexible container** by applying the `display: flex` style to it.
-   Every direct child element in a **flexible container** behaves a little bit differently than normal when adjusting `margin`s.
-   `display: flex` **does not inherit** to child elements.
-   You can put **additional** styles on the flexible container, as well the child elements to change how they behave. [Check the cheatsheet.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

# Flexbox: perfect centering

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="flexboxContainer">
    <h1 class="elementInFlexboxContainer">
        By The Hammer Of Thor! This is exactly in the center of this container!
    </h1>
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

.flexboxContainer {
    display: flex;
    /* don't forget this bit! what happens if you do forget it? */
    height: 100%;
}
.elementInFlexboxContainer {
    margin: auto;
	/* in this case, the margin automatically expands to fill all available
	space in the flex container */
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Flexbox: putting things in rows

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="flexboxContainer">
    <h1 class="elementInFlexboxContainer">
        By Merlin's Beard!
    </h1>
    <h1 class="elementInFlexboxContainer">
        These two elements are side-by-side!
    </h1>
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

.flexboxContainer {
    display: flex;
    /* don't forget this bit! */
    height: 100%;
}
.elementInFlexboxContainer {
    margin: auto;
    /* notice that the two elements aren't actually splitting the page 50/50.
    Any ideas how we could fix that? */
}
```

Hey...we didn't actually change any CSS!

That's because flexbox picks `flex-direction: row` by default. [Check the cheatsheet!](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Flexbox: putting things in columns

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="flexboxContainer">
    <h1 class="elementInFlexboxContainer">
        Great Odin's Ravens!
    </h1>
    <h1 class="elementInFlexboxContainer">
        These two elements are stacked top-to-bottom!
    </h1>
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

.flexboxContainer {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    /* don't forget this bit! */
    height: 100%;
}
.elementInFlexboxContainer {
    margin: auto;
    /* notice that the two elements aren't actually splitting the page 50/50.
    Any ideas how we could fix that? */
}
```

Hey! We didn't really change any HTML that time!

You can use the `flex-direction: column` style to change to a column format.
