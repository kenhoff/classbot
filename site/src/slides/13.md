## Project 3: Coin Flipping App

For your third project, I'd like you to create an app that flips a coin and records the results!

I'd like for you to create a page with two buttons: "Flip coin" and "Reset". Every time you click the "Flip coin" button, your page writes either a "Heads" or "Tails" to the page. Every time you click the "Flip coin" button, the old results stick around, so eventually you'll have a big long list of "Heads" and "Tails".

If you click the "Reset" button, it should clear out all the previous results, and allow you to click the "Flip coin" button for more results.

I should also mention, there should be a 50/50 chance for heads/tails :)

A couple things:

-   For [assignment 14](/assignments/14) (this assignment!), you'll submit a link to your Coin Flipping App. That means that you'll just run `submit 14 http://my-awesome-coin-flipping-app.site44.com/index.html` on @classbot.
-   Whatever URL you submit, please try to keep that live for as long as possible, during and after the class. It gets included on your report card, and it's nice to be able to show it to potential employers and clients.
-   If you'd like to present your progress, you can do so on Session 14. Presenting is totally optional!

# Today - the Browser API!

Bust out those text editors!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What's an API?

API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

Basically, an application (browser, web service, native/mobile phone) has a bunch of commands available to us. We can control the application by running the commands!

## What's the Browser API?

Chrome/Firefox/Edge all have pretty much the same commands that we can run.

These commands allow us to do a couple things with the browser:

-   Manipulate the content of the page
    -   Change the content of text on the page
    -   Add/remove the `class`es of elements on a page, **causing their styles to change**
    -   Even add brand new elements to the page!
-   Listen for user interaction with the page
    -   Has the user clicked this element?
    -   Has the user hit the `escape` key?
-   Retrieve and send data to/from servers on the internet
    -   We'll learn about this in session 15.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# There are **tons** of commands for the browser.

I can't teach you them all!

I'm going to give you a small sampling of some of the commands, just to give you an idea of how they work.

The rest of them? [Check out the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). And remember, Google is your friend!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Selecting Elements

First things first! We need to actually select the elements that we want to manipulate on the page.

## `getElementById`

If we have an element of the page that has a unique `id` attribute, we can use `getElementById` to select it.

If an element with the matching `id` exists, then `getElementById` will **return** the element.

```html
<body>
	<p>
		This is the first paragraph
	</p>
	<p id="myParagraph">
		This is the second paragraph
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the third paragraph
	</p>
	<script>
		// remember, I'm putting the script at the bottom of the body!
		var myParagraphElement = document.getElementById("myParagraph"); // don't forget the quotes!
		console.log(myParagraphElement);
	</script>
</body>
```

> _What is `getElementById`? Is it a string, or a number, or an object? Where is it defined?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `getElementsByClassName`

If we have several elements on the page with the same `class`, we can use `getElementsByClassName`.

`getElementsByClassName` will return an **array** of the elements that have the matching `class`.

```html
<body>
	<p class="rightAligned">
		This is the first paragraph
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the second paragraph
	</p>
	<p class="rightAligned">
		This is the third paragraph
	</p>
	<script>
		var rightAlignedParagraphs = document.getElementsByClassName("rightAligned");
		console.log(rightAlignedParagraphs);
	</script>
</body>
```

> _What happens if I have no elements with the class `rightAligned` on the page? What does `getElementsByClassName` return?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## `getElementsByTagName`

Hey, if you want to get all of the elements with the same tag, whatever works for you.

```html
<body>
	<p>
		This is the first paragraph
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the second paragraph
	</p>
	<p>
		This is the third paragraph
	</p>
	<script>
		var allMyParagraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
		console.log(allMyParagraphs);
	</script>
</body>
```

> _What the heck is `document`, anyway?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Elements

Now that we've selected some elements, let's actually manipulate them!

## `element.innerHTML`

`innerHTML` allows us to access and modify whatever is actually in the element that we've selected.

```html
<body>
	<div class="kanyeQuotes">
		<p>
			My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hate when I'm on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
		</p>
	</div>
	<script>
		var allMyParagraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
		for (var i = 0; i < allMyParagraphs.length; i++) {
			allMyParagraphs[i].innerHTML = "Liz Lemon, " + allMyParagraphs[i].innerHTML;
		}
	</script>
</body>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `document.createElement`

We can create a new HTML element with the `document.createElement` function, but **it doesn't attach the element to the page yet.**

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<h1>where's our new element?</h1>

<script src="myscript.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var myNewParagraphTag = document.createElement("p");
console.log(myNewParagraphTag);
myNewParagraphTag.innerHTML = "hello!";
console.log(myNewParagraphTag);
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `.appendChild()`

In order to attach out new element to the page, we first need to find an HTML element and then call `.appendChild(newElement)` on the existing HTML element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<h1>where's our new element?</h1>

<div id="container"></div>

<script src="myscript.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var myNewParagraphTag = document.createElement("p");
myNewParagraphTag.innerHTML = "hello!";
var containerElement = document.getElementById("container");
console.log(containerElement);
containerElement.appendChild(myNewParagraphTag);
console.log(containerElement);
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `onclick`

What if we want to have an alert-ish element that hides after we click it?

```html
<body>
	<div id="myAlert">
		Hey! This is an alert thing. Click me!
	</div>
	<script>
		var myAlertElement = document.getElementById("myAlert");
		myAlertElement.onclick = function () {
			alert("Hey! Quit clicking me!");
		}
	</script>
</body>
```

> _There's another way to do it too, with the `onclick` attribute on HTML elements._
>
> _What happens if you try to assign an `onclick` function on an element twice?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# onkeypress

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<h1>turn down for</h1>

<script src="myscript.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

document.onkeypress = function () {
	console.log("what");
}
```

> _There's also `onkeydown` and `onkeyup` events._
>
> _How do I tell what key was pressed?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `classList`, `add`, and `remove`

We still need to hide the element though :)

```html
<head>
	<style>
		.hidden {
			display: none;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<div id="myAlert">
		Hey! This is an alert thing. Click me!
	</div>
	<script>
		var myAlertElement = document.getElementById("myAlert");
		myAlertElement.onclick = function() {
			myAlertElement.classList.add("hidden");
		}
	</script>
</body>
```
