Tonight: jQuery!

What is jQuery?
jQuery is a library (a bunch of JavaScript that other people wrote that we can use) that provides a bunch of handy-dandy functions to make our life easier.

jQuery provides functions for us to select elements, manipulate HTML and CSS, and make requests across the network - just like JavaScript, but much easier!

Installing jQuery
Just include it via CDN:

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.2.min.js"></script>

Don’t forget, this should go in <head>!


Including jQuery on your site
It can be a tremendous pain in the ass.

General rule:
Put the <script> tag to the jQuery CDN in <head>.

Put the <script> tag to myScript.js as the last element of <body>. Don’t worry about any other initialization or $(document).ready() crap.

Literally everything that jQuery does
https://api.jquery.com/

Copy and paste with reckless abandon!

Selecting elements using jQuery
Just like CSS!

$(“div”) ← selects all divs
$(“.section”) ← selects all elements with class “section”
$(“#navbar”) ← selects all elements with id “navbar”

Spoiler Alert!
(we’re gonna build a spoiler alert
 thing today)

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/i2mg6/attention_we_now_have_a_new_spoilertagging_system/

.hide()
$(“.spoiler”).hide()

(should probably call this as soon as we load the page!)

.show()
$(“.spoiler”).show()

Wait, we don’t want to do this right away! We only want to show it when we click on “reveal spoiler”!

.click()
$(".revealSpoiler").click(function() {
$(".spoiler").show();
});



Literally everything else that jQuery does
https://api.jquery.com/

Copy and paste with reckless abandon!

That’s it!


Excelsior! 🚀
