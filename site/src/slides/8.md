Flexbox and media queries

# More Dumb Fun Web Stuff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Flexbox 101

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# the `display: flex` style

Remember that most of the `display` styles have to do with how an element is **sized**, but `display: flex` is a bit different.

`display: flex` is sized like a block element, but affects the positioning of all of the elements inside of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setting `margin` on flexbox child elements

90% of your layout needs can be solved just by putting appropriate margins on all of the flexbox child elements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `flex-direction`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `flex-wrap`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `justify-content`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `align-items`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# main axis vs cross-axis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Responsiveness

**Responsiveness** is the word we use to describe how a page changes **in response** to different dimensions or screen sizes.

Because pages typically scroll vertically, we just want to change what the page looks like at different **widths**.

![](https://dailypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/20160523-responsive-design3.gif?w=1160&h=660)

It would be a total pain to try to figure out what your page should look like at every possible screen width, so you generally just pick various ranges of width, and determine your layout within each one of those ranges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chrome dev tools: the device toolbar

If you open up dev tools in Chrome, you'll see a little phone icon next to the "Inspect" button.

![](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/imgs/device-mode-initial-view.png)

This turns on device mode, which will let you simulate various devices and widths for your page.

If you're looking for a couple standard widths for phones, tablets, etc, set the device to "Responsive" and click some of the bars above the page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Media queries

**Media queries** let us change what styles are applied based on various properties of the device that's viewing the page. They go in your CSS.

Mainly, media queries are used to **override** styles at various screen widths:

```css
/* style.css */

@media (min-width: 600px) {
    .navbar {
        flex-direction: row;
    }
}
```

However, you can also use media queries to change how your page looks when people try to print it:

```css
/* style.css */

@media print {
    .header {
        display: none;
    }
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `min-width`

I always get a little confused with `min-width`, and I'm pretty sure it's because it doesn't look like a math equation.

`min-width` says, _"as long as the screen is **at least** this many pixels wide, apply the listed styles"_

Those styles might override previous styles!

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    this div's background color changes based on how wide the screen is! by default it's red, but at >425px it's green, and at >768px it's blue!
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    background-color: red;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
}
@media (min-width: 425px) {
    div {
        background-color: green;
    }
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    div {
        background-color: blue;
    }
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Changing layouts with media queries

One of the most common things that you can do with media queries is to change layouts between column and row formats.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="main">
    <div class="nav">
        <p>
            this is my navigation section. it stays at the top on mobile, but moves to the left column on >768px screens.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>home</li>
            <li>about</li>
            <li>projects</li>
            <li>contact</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">

</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */


/* by default, we don't apply any layout styles! just some colors. */

* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
.main {
    background-color: red;
    padding: 10px;
}
.nav {
    background-color: green;
}
.content {
    background-color: blue;
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .main {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
    }
    .nav {
        width: 20%;
    }
    .content {
        width: 80%;
    }
}
```

# When designing your page

Start with laying out how your page is going to look at your **smallest** page width, and write your styles as if that was the only layout you had.

Then, add media queries to modify that style and layout, using the `min-width` media query.

# Stuff for tonight:

-   Complete [assignment 8](/assignments/8)
-   [Readings 9](/readings/9) is just a list of potential clients for your client project, so if you've already got a client figured out (through @dannywalsh) don't worry about it.
-   Try to make some progress on your client project! Find a client, meet with a client, build something for a client.
    -   Remember, once you've done some work for a client, submit it on [assignment 9](/assignments/9)
    -   If you're looking for a client, get in touch with @dannywalsh on Slack!

This means that we can apply a completely different set of styles based on if a user is on a desktop, tablet (landscape), tablet (portrait), phablet, phone, or Nokia 3310!
