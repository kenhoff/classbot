That’s it!

Don’t forget -
Look stuff up on the internet
Make stuff
Repeat

Excelsior!

Centering

Screw it - just use flexbox.

The absolute best guide to flexbox: <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/>

tons of flexbox options.

Note - IE 9 and earlier doesn't support flexbox.

Web developers love having to support old IE versions.

Centering

`.container { display: flex; }`

`.elementInContainer { margin: auto; }`

don't forget to give the container a height if you want it vertically centered!

The CSS Box Model

Every element is a rectangular box.

Each box has width, height, and a top/bottom/left/right border, margin, and padding

More info: <https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/>

Almost every site on the internet is built out of nested boxes (usually `<div>`s)

The CSS Box Model.

Lay out the content on your page using nested boxes!

To adjust your boxes:

width

height

padding (padding-top/bottom/left/right)

border-style, border-width, border-radius, border-color

margin (margin-top/bottom/left/right)

# block vs inline vs inline-block

display: block takes up the entire width of an element, and can't be placed side-by-side to other elements. Its height and width can be changed!

display: inline only takes up as much space as its content does, and is placed side-by-side to other elements. Its height and width cannot be changed!

display: inline-block only takes up as much space as its content does, and is placed side-by-side to other elements. Its height and width can be changed!

Bootstrap themes!

Bootstrap theme sites

Generally, there's 4 sites that I turn to for themes:

<https://bootswatch.com/>

Literally just reskins of Bootstrap

<http://startbootstrap.com/>

Classy, free portfolio-ish sites. 1 or 2 app admin sites.

<http://www.bootstrapzero.com/>

Compilation from a bunch of free themes around the web - ymmv.

<https://wrapbootstrap.com/>

Paid themes - some powerful, some...meh. Careful about the code quality on a lot of these.

There's probably lots more places to get themes out there!





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's build! - Bootswatch

<https://bootswatch.com/>

Literally just reskins of original Bootstrap

If you've built a site with Bootstrap, you can just include a Bootswatch theme instead of the builtin Bootstrap theme, and everything will still work fine, just with a different theme

Can also use the Bootswatch CDN: <https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's build! - StartBootstrap

<http://startbootstrap.com/>

Not quite reskins of original bootstrap, but still reuses a lot of the components

Most of these are one page sites

The best way to learn these? Experiment

Tons more bootstrap resources

<http://startbootstrap.com/bootstrap-resources/>

That's it!

Case study in responsiveness

Responsiveness - how a page changes on different devices (usually just different page widths)

(also, every single article from Boz is great)
