Javascript 102: variables, loops, and functions

# Variables

Variables

Store references to things in variables!

Generally not required at first, but it’ll make things a lot easier as your JS gets more complex.




Variables
A variable is like a box - you can put stuff in it, you can take stuff out of it, and you can read what’s in it. It can only hold one thing at a time.
```
var x = 1;			// assigning the number 1 to the variable x

console.log(x); 		// 1

var x = "a string";	// assigning the string "a string" to the variable x

console.log(x); 		// a string

var x = null;		// assigning nothing to the variable x

console.log(x); 		// null
```

# Loops


Loops iterate over an array. There are lots of ways to do loops, but I prefer this one:

```
var myArray = ["element 0", 12345, "element 2"];
for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
	// first, var i = 0
	// then, do whatever's in the curly brackets, as long as i is less than myArray.length (which happens to be 3)
	// then, after each time that you do whatever's in the curly brackets, increment i by 1
	console.log(myArray[i]);
}
// element 0
// 12345
// element 2
```

# Functions


A function is a set of instructions that you can run over and over again. They take arguments, and (optionally) return variables.

```
function addTwoNumbers(a, b) { 	// definining our function as addTwoNumbers
		return a + b 			// specifying the arguments that it takes as a, b
} 							// return the value of a + b
var result = addTwoNumbers(1, 2); 	// call the function addTwoNumbers, store the return value
console.log(result); 			// 3
```


But wait! There’s a gotcha.

Things get weird if you pass in an object or array (vs a number or string) to a function.

Functions will modify objects or arrays, even if you don’t explicitly return them.

(Functions won’t modify numbers or strings, unless you explicitly return them.)

This is called “pass by reference” for objects and arrays, vs “pass by value” for numbers and strings.
