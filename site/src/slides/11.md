# Project 3: Coin Flipping App

For your third project, I'd like you to create an app that flips a coin and records the results!

I'd like for you to create a page with two buttons: "Flip coin" and "Reset". Every time you click the "Flip coin" button, your page writes either a "Heads" or "Tails" to the page. Every time you click the "Flip coin" button, the old results stick around, so eventually you'll have a big long list of "Heads" and "Tails".

If you click the "Reset" button, it should clear out all the previous results, and allow you to click the "Flip coin" button for more results.

I should also mention, there should be a 50/50 chance for heads/tails :)

A couple things:

-   For [assignment 14](/assignments/14), you'll submit a link to your Coin Flipping App. That means that you'll just run `submit 14 http://my-awesome-coin-flipping-app.site44.com/index.html` on @classbot.
-   Whatever URL you submit, please try to keep that live for as long as possible, during and after the class. It gets included on your report card, and it's nice to be able to show it to potential employers and clients.
-   If you'd like to present your progress, you can do so on Session 14. Presenting is totally optional!

# More Dumb Fun Web Stuff

[Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)!

Clickers are fun (maybe?) little (sometimes) games that are written entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No 3D graphics here - just a little manipulation of `<div>`s and a lot of calculation of how many `insert-currency-token-here`'s you've got.

These get a little more complicated too! Check out these pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript clickers:

-   [A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/)
-   [Candy Box](http://candies.aniwey.net/)
-   [Candy Box 2](http://candybox2.net/)

And, here's an [Extra Credits episode on Skinner Boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWtvrPTbQ_c).

# Comments

Want to "comment" something out, just like in HTML?

Use `//` at the beginning of a line.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

// this is a really important bit of code, right here.
console.log("This will be logged to the console! Hooray!");
// console.log("This won't be logged to the console! Oh no!");
```

If you're writing code that someone else is going to look at in the future, it might be beneficial to leave comments in your code, to explain what you're doing.

You can also comment out JavaScript instructions. Commented instructions won't be executed!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Variables

A variable is like a box - you can put stuff in it, you can take stuff out of it, and you can read whatâ€™s in it.

## Declaring, assigning, and using variables

Let's _declare_ a variable, and _assign_ a value to it. Then, we'll log that variable out to the console.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var myVariable = "Hello, World!";
console.log(myVariable);
```

Notice a couple things:

1.  You'll need to put the word `var` before your variable to tell the browser "hey, this is a variable".
2.  It might make more sense if you think about putting the thing on the right-hand side _into_ the thing on the left-hand side. (Putting the value `"Hello, World!"` into `myVariable`)
3.  For this example, our value needs to be wrapped in quotation marks.
4.  Don't forget to end with a semicolon!

> _What happens if we don't declare our variable? (e.g., if we forgot to include the first line, and just tried to log `myVariable`?)_

## Overwriting/assigning new values to variables

Variables can only hold one thing at a time - if you want to put something else in the variable, it overwrites whatever's already in there.

Let's declare another variable, assign a value to it, log it to the console, assign another value to it, and try logging it to the console again.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var myVariable = "Hello, World!";
console.log(myVariable);
var myVariable = "Goodbye, World!";
console.log(myVariable);
```

> _[What happens if you set the value of a variable to **another** variable?](https://media.giphy.com/media/NQG4PEJxpLxCg/giphy.gif)_

## What can we put in variables?

Lots of things!

For the time being, we'll just have you put **Strings** and **Numbers** in variables.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var myString = "Ken";
var myNumber = 27;
```

Numbers don't need quotation marks!

In the next session, we'll learn about assigning Arrays and Objects to variables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Conditional statements

**Conditional statments** tell the browser to do something (or to not do something) based on if a condition is true or not.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var person = "Ken";
var age = 27;

console.log("Hello, " + person + "! You are " + age + " years old.");

if (age < 26) {
	console.log("What a young, spry, and good-looking individual!");
} else {
	console.log("Wow. You are old. Your life is basically over.");
}
```

> _Notice here that we're "adding" three strings together to create a new string!_

What other "operators" are there? What happens if we use `<=`, `>`, or `==` in our `if` statement?

> _What if we forgot to include the `else` statement, and just had that `console.log("...")` instead? What would be logged to the console?_

There's some other statements that you can use, like `else if` and `switch`, but I'll let you discover those on your own.

[Comparison Operators!](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Loops

Loops tell the browser, "do this thing `n` times in a row".

## A basic `while` loop

The most basic loop is called a `while` loop. It uses a conditional, and executes all of the code within the curly brackets while the conditional is true.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var age = 27;
var startingAge = 0;
while (startingAge < age) {
	console.log("Happy " + startingAge + "th Birthday!");
	startingAge = startingAge + 1;
}
```

## A slightly more complicated `for` loop

There are a couple different ways to do loops, but I prefer this one:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

for (var i = 0; i < 27; i++) {
	console.log("Happy " + i + "th Birthday!");
}
```

Inside the parentheses, there are three JavaScript expressions:

1.  What should be executed at the beginning of the loop
    -   For this example, we declare and initialize our variable `i` to the number 0.
2.  A conditional statement that's evaluated at the beginning of each loop - if it evaluates to `true`, then run the iteration. If it evaluates to `false`, stop the loop.
    -   For this example, we check to see if `i` is less than `10` every single iteration. If `i` is equal to or greater than `10`, we stop the loop.
3.  What should be executed after every iteration of the loop.
    -   For this example, we _increment_ `i` by `1` every time we go through the loop.
    -   `i++` is a shorthand for saying `i = i + 1`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Functions

A function is a set of instructions that you can tell the browser to run at any time.

We'd want to use a function anytime that we find ourselves _repeating code_. This is a little hard to tell initially, but you'll get much better at it as you write more code.

Splitting a big hairy spaghetti mess of code into a bunch of smaller functions improves readability, and makes it easier for us to debug and add new code. If you find yourself with some massive file that's too complex to understand, I'd recommend splitting it into functions!

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/PxSFAnuubLkSA/giphy.gif)

There are three parts to a function - the function **name**, the function **parameters**, and the function's **return statement**.

## Function names

Here's a function that logs `Hello, World!` to the console:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

function sayHelloWorld() {
	console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

We can then **call** our function using the function name:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

function sayHelloWorld() {
	console.log("Hello, World!");
}

sayHelloWorld();
```

Function names can only contain letters and numbers - no spaces or dashes! Underscores are fine though.

## Function parameters

**Parameters** are essentially variables that are passed into our functions! It's as if we declared a variable (named the same thing as our parameter) at the beginning of our function.

Here's a function that has a name, has one **parameter**, and logs out `Hello, <someone>!`:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

function sayHello(someone) {
	console.log("Hello, " + someone + "!");
}
```

Then, we can call our function with an argument:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

function sayHello(someone) {
	console.log("Hello, " + someone + "!");
}

sayHello("World");
sayHello("Ken");
```

> _What happens if we don't "pass in" anything to our function?_

## Function return statements

Sometimes we don't want the function to log anything out, and instead we want it to return a new, computed value to us. For that, we need a **return** statement.

This isn't so useful at the moment, but when you start re-using code, it'll become more valuable.

This function has a name, has one parameter, and **returns** the result.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

function createHelloString(someone) {
	return ("Hello, " + someone + "!");
}
```

We can then call the function, assign the result of the function to a variable, and log out the result.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

function createHelloString(someone) {
	return ("Hello, " + someone + "!");
}

var helloString = createHelloString("Ken");
console.log(helloString);
```

What happens if we just log `createHelloString("Ken")`?

> _Advanced: what happens if we just log `createHelloString`, no quotes or parentheses?_

# Advanced stuff

If you're a CS major, you might be interested in this stuff. Otherwise, you probably won't ever run into this.

## Is JavaScript pass-by-value or pass-by-reference?

Both!

As a general rule of thumb, JavaScript uses pass-by-value when passing Numbers and Strings ([primitive types](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/the-secret-life-of-javascript-primitives/)) to a function. Otherwise, when passing Arrays and Objects to a function, it uses pass-by-reference.

## You now have all of the information you need to solve the #1 interview question for software developers, FizzBuzz!

I want you to loop through all numbers, 1 through 100.

If the number is divisible by 3, log `Fizz` to the console.

If the number is divisible by 5, log `Buzz` to the console.

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, log `FizzBuzz` to the console.
