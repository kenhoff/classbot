# Project 2: Client Project

For your second project, I'd like you to work with a client to build something web-dev related for them!

The scope of your project is really up to you. I'd recommend building some kind of landing page or marketing site for the client - HTML, CSS, text, images, links, everything.

If the client wants you to improve on an _existing_ site, it's _possible_, but I'd be careful - monkeying around with prepackaged Wordpress/Squarespace themes is a pretty easy way to get a headache.

If you've already got a client, great! If you need a client, I'd recommend first reaching out to @dannywalsh on Slack, and if you still can't find anyone, you can try emailing some of the folks listed on [readings 9](/readings/9).

A couple things:

-   For [assignment 5](/assignments/5), you'll submit a link to your client's existing web presence. This is just something to help us understand who your client is. If they don't have an existing web presence, just submit a link to their Facebook, Twitter, or even Google Maps location.
-   For [assignment 9](/assignments/9) (this assignment!), you'll submit a link to whatever you created for the client. That means that you'll just run `submit 9 http://my-awesome-client-project.site44.com/index.html` on @classbot.
-   Whatever URL you submit, please try to keep that live for as long as possible, during and after the class. It gets included on your report card, and it's nice to be able to show it to potential employers and clients.
-   If you'd like to present your progress, you can do so on Session 9. Presenting is totally optional!

## FAQ

**Q: Do they have to pay me?**

A: Nope! They don't have to. Part of the class work and all.

**Q: Are they allowed to pay me?**

A: Of course! (but make sure it's a small amount, otherwise you'll have to sign paperwork and stuff)

**Q: What if I can't get it done in time for session 9?**

A: I don't expect this to be completely done by Session 9! Your clients will likely be finnicky and temperamental, and delays in projects happen. Submit your site whenever it's all done, hopefully by the end of the class.

**Q: Does the client have to use what I make?**

A: Nope - the client is under no obligation to publicly use your work. If they would like to, they totally can!

# The CSS Box Model

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/thebox.png)

Two things to remember:

1.  Every page on the internet is just a series of nested boxes
2.  Check out the CSS box model by using your browser's dev tools (right-click an element -> Inspect)

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/firebox.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Height and width

Pretty straightforward - we've gone over this a bunch already.

One thing that I want to draw attention to is that the height and width only applies to the **content** of an element. We'll see why this matters in a few slides.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    This content is 100px by 100px.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Border

Again, already seen a bunch of this.

Did you know that you [can use images in your border](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-image.asp)? Here's an example of a site that uses it: <http://luftrausers.com/>

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    This content has a funky border.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
	background-color: chartreuse;
    border: 5px dashed fuchsia;
}
```

Whoa...what style did we just apply there?

## Border shorthands

Instead of declaring `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color` individually, we can set all of them at once with the `border` style. It's called a **shorthand**.

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    border: <br-width> || <br-style> || <color>;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

In a pinch? You can always declare individual styles for individual sides (e.g. `border-style-bottom`, `border-color-left`). You can even declare a generic `border` style first, then override them with more specific styles in the same CSS declaration.

Learn all about the shorthands for `border` at the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Shorthands

Turns out there's tons of shorthands!

In the future, I'll try to use shorthands as much as possible.

For most of these shorthands, the **number** and **order** of the arguments matter!

## `margin` / `padding`

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    margin: 100px;
    /* all four sides */
    margin: 100px 200px;
    /* vertical / horizontal */
    margin: 100px 200px 300px;
    /* top / horizontal / bottom */
    margin: 100px 200px 300px 400px;
    /* top / right / bottom / left (clockwise)*/
}
```

## `background`

Let's just say [it's complicated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background).

Shorthands a little too overwhelming? No worries at all, just use the explicit styles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Padding

We've seen `padding` already!

Remember, `padding` is used to push the **content** away from the edges of your box.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    So padding. Wow.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    padding: 100px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# er...what?

What's the **actual** width of each one of these elements?

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="normal">
    this content has a height of 300px by 300px.
</div>
<div class="withpadding">
    this content has a height of 300px by 300px.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    height: 300px;
    width: 300px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
.withpadding {
    padding: 100px;
    background-color: red;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enter `box-sizing`

By default, all HTML elements have `box-sizing` set to `content-box`.

This means that the `height` and `width` only apply to the content. This means that `padding` and `margin` expand the actual dimensions of the element.

Sometimes that's not what we want! Sometimes it's much easier to consider `padding` as part of the element that you're sizing.

If you set `box-sizing: border-box;`, then whenever you set `height` or `width`, the browser will automatically factor the `padding` into the desired dimensions, and adjust the content of the element accordingly.

In the previous example, if we set `box-sizing: border-box;`, then all of our `div`s have the same dimensions, regardless of their padding:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="normal">
    this **element** has a height of 300px by 300px.
</div>
<div class="withpadding">
    this **element** has a height of 300px by 300px.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    height: 300px;
    width: 300px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
.withpadding {
    padding: 100px;
    background-color: red;
}
```

For more info, check out the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Margin

You might have poked around a bit with margins already!

Remember, margins push other elements away from your element, but don't actually represent the space within your element. Margins are transparent! They don't have any background properties, so keep that in mind when deciding to use `margin` or `padding`.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    this element is 100px by 100px, and has some margin.
</div>
<div>
    this element also 100px by 100px, and has some margin.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin: 100px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

Blarg...notice what's wrong here?

What's the height and width of the elements?

What's the margin on each element?

How far apart should those two elements be?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Collapsing margins

Ugh...this is why CSS gets a lot of flak from the programming community. All of these little gotchas that are leftover from the Web 1.0 era!

If you have two block elements that both have top/bottom margins, then those margins might get **collapsed** to a smaller margin.

This was originally intended just for paragraphs, to provide extra spacing on the start/finish of a block of text while retaining spacing in the middle, just to make it a little easier to create and style.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<p>
    This paragraph element has height 100px and width 300px, with a top/bottom margin of 100px. Use your dev tools to inspect it!
</p>
<p>
    This paragraph has the same dimensions and margin, but notice that instead of the space between these two paragraphs being 200px, it's collapsed to 100px.
</p>
<p>
    The margins before/after this group of paragraphs remain the same.
</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

p {
    height: 100px;
    width: 300px;
    margin: 100px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

I don't expect you to have to deal with or even know much about collapsing margins. I just want to let you know that they exist, so that you know what you're seeing when you can't figure out why your paragraph margins aren't working correctly.

Here are a [couple](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) [of](https://css-tricks.com/what-you-should-know-about-collapsing-margins/) [resources](https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/collapsing-margins/) for understanding and handling collapsing margins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Putting it all together

Blegh. CSS layouts are complicated. Just wait til we get to `display`, `position` and media queries!

Still got your portfolio site? Try adding a bunch of margins/padding/sizing to all of your different elements.

Simply adding whitespace does wonders for getting users to focus on what really matters on your page.

# The `display` style

Every element on the page already has a `display` style declared on it!

The vast majority of them are `display: block`.

Some of them (like `<a>`, `<span>`, and `<img>` tags) are `display: inline`.

The `<head>` tag has `display: none`, which means that our `<meta>`, `<link>` and `<title>` tags don't get displayed.

To see this, bust open your dev tools, inspect the various elements, and check the "Computed" styles of the elements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: block`

By default, elements with `display: block` stretch all the way across to fill the parent container.

`div`s, headings, paragraphs, and most other elements have `display: block` by default!

Anchor tags and `span`s **don't** have `display: block` by default.

(If you really want, you can set them to be `display: block`, but I wouldn't recommend it.)

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    divs have display: block by default.
</div>
<div>
    notice how it stretches all the way across to fill the container?
</div>
<div class="fiftyPercent">
    <div>
        even if it's nested.
    </div>
</div>
<h1>headings have display: block by default,</h1>
<p>
    as well as paragraphs.
</p>
<a href="#">links and spans aren't display: block by default!</a>
<span>they don't stretch to fill the container automatically.</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div, h1, p, a, span {
    background-color: lightgray;
    margin: 10px;
}
.fiftyPercent {
    width: 50%;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: block` stacks vertically, regardless of element width

Even if I have a bunch of small elements with `display: block`, they'll stack in a column instead of a row.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    Even if my block-level elements are small
</div>
<div>
    And could easily stack in a row
</div>
<div>
    display: block will make them stack in a column
</div>
<div>
    regardless of width
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    background-color: lightgray;
    width: 25%;
    margin: 10px;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: inline`

What does an element with `display: inline` look like?

`display: inline` elements are commonly used inside other elements where it's important to not disrupt the flow of the content. They can also wrap over multiple lines!

`<a>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` and `<img>` tags are `display: inline` by default.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<p>
    Daftendirekt. Discovery doin' it right, oh yeah robot rock high life. Beyond burnin' get lucky. Discovery voyager voyager revolution 909. Funk. <a href="#">Inline elements are commonly found within other elements where it's important not to break the flow of the parent element.</a> Oh yeah, rollin' and scratchin' revolution 909 nightvision veridis quo. Within discovery. <span>They can also wrap over multiple lines!</span> Crescendolls fragments of time, technologic revolution 909 steam machine. Giorgio by moroder instant crush, touch touch. Veridis quo.
</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

a, span {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```

## Inline element stacking

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<span>If you have a bunch of inline elements, </span><span>they'll always stack in a row, </span><span>and can wrap down to the next line mid-element.</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

span {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```

## Inline element weirdness

Generally, **you cannot set the dimensions** of an element with `display: inline`.

However, even though `<img>` elements are **inline by default**, you can set the dimensions of those without issue.

Things get pretty weird when you try to throw `margin` or `padding` on an element with `display: inline`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: none`

`display: none` pretty much does exactly what you'd expect it to.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    This element isn't displayed on the page, but you can still see it in the page HTML! Check your dev tools.
</div>
<div>
    It's not invisible, and there's no space for it on the page - it's just not there!
</div>
<div>
    SpoooOooOooOOOooky!
</div>

<span>did somebody say something?</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    display: none;
}
```
