# The Social Network Front End Project

For your final project, I'm going to have you create the **front end** to the Spark Front End Web Development Social Network.

All of the students in the class are on the Social Network! You can create new posts, and everyone else in the Social Network can see those posts.

For your front end,  you'll need at least 2 pages:

-   a **main page** which shows all the posts in the Social Network
    -   The main page (probably your `index.html`) should show all the posts in the Social Network, from most recent to least recent. Each post has some content, an author, and a date/time that it was created.
-   a **secret posting page** that lets you post to the Social Network
    -   Your posting page should have a text box where you can punch in some content, and then a button that lets you create a post on the Social Network. **Your posting page should be secret! Only you should know the URL for it, otherwise other people will be able to post to your profile.**

You'll need to make requests to the API to create and get posts on the Social Network. All of the API documentation is up at <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/>.

Some notes:

-   Your `profile_id` is just your Slack username.
-   You'll need a `profile_secret` in order to post to the Social Network. I'll direct message you your `profile_secret` in Slack.
-   Don't share your `profile_secret` with anyone, and don't share the URL of your posting page with anyone, or else they'll be able to post to your profile as you!
-   Don't put your `profile_secret` anywhere in your `index.html`, and don't include it in any scripts that are included in your `index.html` - otherwise, I'll be able to open that script and find it.
-   Use common sense when creating a post on the Social Network. I'm not moderating it at all, but keep it PG-13 please.
-   Use common sense when using the Social Network API. It can pretty easily handle 1000s of posts, but it doesn't have any restrictions on the amount of posts that you can create, or how often you create posts. If you write a `for` loop that does nothing but create spam posts all day, then I'm going to be sad :(

Logistics:

-   Remember to create a separate site44 site, and keep it up after the class ends so that potential clients and employers can see it!
-   Submit your site44 site for [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   This info is available on [readings 19](/readings/19) and [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   Ask for help! I just wrote this thing, so if something's not so clear, I can definitely improve it. Let me know!

# Tonight

jQuery advanced methods and HTTP requests!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More jQuery methods: `.click()`

You can listen for clicks on elements pretty easily with jQuery!

The `.click()` method takes one argument, a **function**.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<button class="profoundButton">Tell me something profound</button>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$(".profoundButton").click(function () {
	alert("Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.");
});
```

> _What if I had more than one button with the class of `profoundButton`?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More jQuery methods: `.hide()` and `.show()`

The `.hide()` and `.show()` methods use CSS to hide and show stuff!

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p class="quote">
			Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
		</p>
		<button class="showButton">Show me a quote!</button>
		<button class="hideButton">I don't want to see that quote anymore, hide it!</button>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$(".quote").hide();
$(".showButton").click(function() {
	$(".quote").show();
});
$(".hideButton").click(function() {
	$(".quote").hide();
});
```

> _What CSS styles do `.hide()` and `.show()` apply?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Creating new HTML elements with jQuery

You can create elements by passing an HTML string instead of a selector string to `$`:

```javascript
$( "<p>Test</p>" ).appendTo( ".inner" );
```

Ken's recommendation: use `.appendTo()` (<http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/>). You can try using `.add()`, but I've never been any good at figuring out which is the source and which is the target.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# HTTP Requests

HTTP stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**.

Every time a client (your computer) needs to get something from a server, it sends the server something called an **HTTP Request**.

Then, the server sends an **HTTP Response** back.

## HTTP Requests - Advanced

Here's a couple situations in which HTTP requests and responses are used:

-   Any time that you request the page `http://www.google.com`, your computer makes an HTTP request, and Google sends back an HTTP response, **containing the content of the page**.
-   Any time that you log into Facebook, your computer makes an HTTP request to Facebook **containing your username and password**, and Facebook sends back an HTTP response saying if they were correct or not.
-   Any time that you load up a page with an `<img src = "kittens.jpg">`, the browser realizes that it doesn't have `kittens.jpg`, and makes an HTTP request asking for `kittens.jpg`. If the server has `kittens.jpg`, it sends back an HTTP response containing the data for `kittens.jpg`, or a response with status code 404 if it can't find it.
-   Any time that you post a new tweet, your computer sends an HTTP request to `twitter.com` **containing the contents of your tweet**. If the posting was successful, the browser sends back an HTTP response saying that it was successful. If it wasn't successful, it might send back some other kind of status code.

> _I'm abstracting a lot here - HTTP actually runs "on top of" another protocol called TCP/IP._
>
> _TCP/IP takes a bunch of data, separates it into chunks, converts it into the `1`s and `0`s needed to send it over the wire to the other computer._
>
> _For the ultra-curious, here's what an HTTP request from a client to a server looks like:_

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

> _And here's what the server would send back to the client:_

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The two popular types of HTTP requests

The two main types of HTTP requests are **GET** requests and **POST** requests.

We use **GET** requests whenever we want to **read** data:

-   get the HTML for google.com -> every time your browser needs the HTML for google.com, it makes a GET request!
-   get a list of posts from the Social Network API
-   get a list of profiles from the Social Network API
-   get a specific profile from the Social Network API

We use **POST** requests whenever we want to **write** or **submit** data.

-   submit a new tweet to twitter.com
-   submit a new post to the Social Network API

> _There are a bunch more "verbs" besides GET and POST, like PATCH, PUT, and DELETE. Sometimes you'll hear about OPTIONS or HEAD._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sending HTTP GET requests with jQuery's `$.ajax()`

(I'll talk about what "AJAX" actually is in just a minute)

jQuery's `$.ajax()` documentation: <http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/>

Notice that we just use `$`, not `$()`!

Let's try just getting the HTML of <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/> right now:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.get("https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/").done(function (data) {
	console.log(data);
});
```

> _Why don't we use `https://www.google.com`? Check out Cross-origin resource sharing:_ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AJAX / `XMLHttpRequest`

AJAX stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**.

AJAX is the _technique_ by which we use JavaScript to fetch data from other servers - exactly what we were just doing.

AJAX relies on the Browser API `XMLHttpRequest` to make HTTP requests.

While I hope you never ever have to build an `XMLHttpRequest` manually (it's obnoxiously complicated), it is good to know that the underlying technology exists - that's a question I've actually had in an interview.

MDN's intro on AJAX: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started>

MDN's official docs on `XMLHttpRequest`: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting data from an API with jQuery's `$.ajax()`

Now, let's actually get the list of posts from the Social Network API! Let's look at the "Getting Started" section on <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/#getting-started>:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts",
	method: "GET"
}).done(function(data) {
	// the request has succeeded
	console.log(data);
}).fail(function(jqXHR, status, error) {
	// the request has failed
	console.log(error);
});
```

Hey look! The `data` that the API gives us back is already in the format of a JavaScript object or array. That's convenient!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `$.ajax` "callback" vs "promises"

You **used** to be able to handle AJAX responses like this (the "callbacks" way):

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts",
	method: "GET"
}, function(data) {
	console.log(data);
});
```

However, they've **removed support for this** in the latest jQuery version, and I don't recommend doing it this way. You'll likely see lots of examples on the internet doing it this way.

My recommendation is to handle AJAX responses like this (the "promises" way):

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts",
	method: "GET"
}).done(function(data) {
	// the request has succeeded
	console.log(data);
}).fail(function(jqXHR, status, error) {
	// the request has failed
	console.log(error);
});
```
