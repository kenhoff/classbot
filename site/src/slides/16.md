jQuery 202: `$`, using jQuery selectors and methods

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THE END IS NIGH

We're approaching the end of the class!

On August 24th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!

Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects:

-   Portfolio (assignment 4)
-   Client Project (assignment 9)
-   TSA Randomizer (assignment 14)
-   Random Quote App (assignment 19)

Remember to check your grades with `grades` on @classbot!

Remember to create separate Firebase apps (or site44 apps) for your projects so that potential clients employers can see them!

# What's `$`?

Remember how to include jQuery on your site?

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
			console.log($);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

When `$` is logged to the console, it should say something like `function (selectors, context) { ... }`.

`$` is a **function** - that means that we can "call" it, just like `sayHello()` or `addTwoNumbers(firstNumber, secondNumber)`.

Let's try calling `$` without any _arguments_, and see what the result is:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
			console.log($);
			var result = $();
			console.log(result);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

I don't actually know what happens! I haven't tested this. What happens?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using jQuery selectors

Generally, whenever we call `$`, we want to provide an _argument_.

The function `$` takes a **string** as the first argument.

The string argument should be a **selector**, just like we use in CSS. That means that you can select elements by `tag`, `.class` or `#id`!

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="kanyeQuotes">
			<p class="profoundQuote">
				My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
			</p>
			<p id="waterBottleQuote">
				I hate when I'm on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.
			</p>
			<p class="profoundQuote">
				Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<script>
			// we'll select three different sets of objects - just comment out the lines that you don't want
			console.log($("p"));
			console.log($(".profoundQuote"));
			console.log($("#waterBottleQuote"));
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

Don't forget! Here's a list of all possible CSS Selectors: <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp>

jQuery supports all those selectors, and some more: <http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/>

> _`$` takes a second argument called `context`, but we generally don't use it. It's handy if you need to use another selector on a set of already-selected elements (sort of like "nested selectors")._
>
> _Here's a fun jQuery line that I wrote last week: `$("td:contains('Time Played') ~ td", $("#competitive-play .career-stats-section .js-stats").slice(0, 1)).text();`_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# jQuery methods

> _Aside: whenever I say "methods", I'm basically saying "functions"._

jQuery has a lot of **methods**! You can see the full list of them here: <http://api.jquery.com/>

_You will never be able to learn all of these methods_. There may be some that you memorize after you use them a couple dozen times, but for the most part, **you should always go look at the documentation**.

**jQuery has some of the best documentation I've seen on the internet**. Some of the methods have documentation with _dozens_ of real-world examples, which you should _copy-and-paste with reckless abandon_!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using jQuery methods

Calling jQuery methods is similar to calling Browser API methods, like `document.getElementsByTagName("p")` or `window.alert()`.

To call jQuery methods, first, call the `$` with a selector, then call the method on the result.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="kanyeQuotes">
			<p id="#profound">
				Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<script>
			var result = $("#profound").html();
			console.log(result);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

> _It's possible to "chain" jQuery methods, so you can call any jQuery method on the **result** of any other jQuery method. You can build big hairy jQuery calls like `$(this).find("li a").eq(2).text().replace("foo", "bar");`_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting and Setting with jQuery methods

It's possible to both **get** (read) and **set** (write) the contents or properties of HTML elements _using a single method_.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="kanyeQuotes">
			<p id="#profound">
				Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<script>
			var result = $("#profound").html();
			console.log(result);
			$("#profound").html("My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.");
			var result = $("#profound").html();
			console.log(result);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More jQuery methods: `.click()`

You can listen for clicks on elements pretty easily with jQuery!

The `.click()` method takes one argument, a **function**.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<button class="profoundButton">Tell me something profound</button>
		<script>
			$(".profoundButton").click(function () {
				alert("Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.");
			});
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

> _What if I had more than one button with the class of `profoundButton`?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More jQuery methods: `.hide()` and `.show()`

The `.hide()` and `.show()` methods use CSS to hide and show stuff!

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p class="quote">
			Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
		</p>
		<button class="showButton">Show me a quote!</button>
		<button class="hideButton">I don't want to see that quote anymore, hide it!</button>
		<script>
			$(".quote").hide();
			$(".showButton").click(function () {
				$(".quote").show();
			});
			$(".hideButton").click(function () {
				$(".quote").hide();
			});
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

# Advanced: Creating new HTML elements with jQuery

You can create elements by passing an HTML string instead of a selector string to `$`:

```javascript
$( "<p>Test</p>" ).appendTo( ".inner" );
```

Ken's recommendation: use `.appendTo()` (<http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/>). You can try using `.add()`, but I've never been any good at figuring out which is the source and which is the target.

We'll probably just head to Illegal Pete's after class next time. If you're not 21, no worries! They have sopapillas and nachos and stuff.
