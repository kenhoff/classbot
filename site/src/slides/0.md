- Make stuff
- Repeat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hi there! I'm Ken.

A little about me:

- Graduated CU December 2013, B.S. in Computer Science
- Worked for Microsoft in Seattle, WA for ~18 months

  - Program Manager at Azure Active Directory

- Recently moved back to Boulder

  - working on Barfly - side-project-turned-full-time-side-project
  - helps bars and restaurants order liquor every week

- For fun, I bike, cook, make video games, and annoy my cat with the ukulele

- More about me at: <https://hoff.tech/>

- Contact is best through Slack, or [ken@hoff.tech](mailto:ken@hoff.tech).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Slack!

<https://sparkfrontendwebdev.slack.com>

Check your email for an invite!

If you don't have one, email [ken@hoff.tech](mailto:ken@hoff.tech) and I can resend it.

We're using Slack for:

- general announcements, team chat, office hours
- session info, lecture slides, readings and assignments (@classbot!)
- attendance (eventually...once I get around to building it)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# @classbot!

**All session info, readings, lecture slides, and assignments are available through the @classbot!**

All assignments should be submitted to @classbot on Slack. Direct message it to get an idea of how it works (try `help`!)

You can submit assignments as many times as you want! We don't mind. We'll always record the **most recent grade**. Type `grades` to get an idea of how you're doing.

_(Obviously, don't submit work that isn't yours to @classbot. CU Honor Code and all, and @classbot records all submissions.)_

I'm still working through the slides and readings from last semester and putting it all on Slackbot. All of the assignments are currently available, but some of the later ones may change a little bit!

If @classbot ever goes down (or becomes unresponsive) please let me know! Just mention or DM me on Slack. Still working out some bugs :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Note: This is Session `0`!

In most programming languages, when you have a list of items, the first element of the list is at _index 0_.

There are a total of 20 sessions in this course, and our final session is session `19`.

This means that you would have completed the readings for session `0` prior to this class (by messaging @classbot `readings 0`) and your assignment tonight is assignment `0` (which you can test and submit by messaging @classbot `submit 0 http://your-url-here.example.com`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Treehouse

Treehouse is our "textbook" for the class.

It has tons and tons of well-produced videos on web design, development, tools, and mobile development!

Each session, I'll select a couple videos to watch before class (check @classbot for which ones - `readings 1` for next time), and briefly go over it in class.

[Use this link to sign up for Treehouse!](http://referrals.trhou.se/kenhoff2)

It's not required to complete any of the quizzes, and I'm not tracking what you've watched (but you should probably still watch it!)

**$25/mo** - if it's a hardship, message me on Slack and let me know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Schedule Overview

## Sessions 1-10: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

June 6th - July 6th

This is pretty stuff, like content and graphic design.

## Sessions 11-20: Javascript, jQuery

July 11th - August 10th

This is interaction stuff, like changing a page without reloading, and using APIs.

Run `sessions` on @classbot to get a list of sessions and dates. (I'm still updating it, but that will be the official record!)

_Note: I'll be out of town June 20th and 22nd, so we won't have class that week. I'll update the @classbot._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Session Format

Lab-focused class - learning by building

**Announcements:** ~5-10 minutes

**Lecture:** ~20-30 minutes

**Lab/work time:** ~45-60 minutes

Tonight: more logistics than lab time, just because we're kicking off, but we're still going to build stuff!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Grading

There aren't any formal grades!

There will be **20 assignments total** - Each assignment is weighted equally (and they're relatively small). **Attendance is taken.**

I provide **attendance, assignment completion information, and an internship recommendation** to the internship placement services at the end of the course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Office Hours

**I'm pretty much always on Slack!** I get notifications from all channels, 24 hours a day.

In-person office hours for Ken are 2 hours before class:

5:30pm-7:30pm, 8pm-9:30pm, Mondays and Wednesdays, here at Spark Boulder.

If that doesn't work for you, message me on Slack and we can find a better time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Help! This class is too hard!

Don't worry - web development is hard. I still feel like a complete noob at it, every day!

Completing all of the assignments is meant to be a **goal** of this class, not a **requirement**. If you're struggling with the assignments, that's okay! Get as much done as you can. Showing ability to work hard and learn is far more important than making a number tick up.

In class, ask a lot of questions, even if they seem like dumb ones - other people have the exact same question, I promise.

Above all, continue Googling, write more code, and keep your ass in the chair until you make some progress!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Help! This class is too easy!

First, complete all of the assignments in the class. You can use the old syllabus (<https://hoff.tech/classes/frontendwebdev>) if you get confused on any of them, but keep in mind that some of the later ones may change.

Once you've completed all the assignments, I can work with you on some advanced assignments. Things like transpilers, preprocessors, templates, build pipelines, and frontend frameworks are all fair game.

If you're really _really_ itching for a challenge, go check out <https://www.stockfighter.io/>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What is web development?

Let's check out a couple pages for examples:

<https://www.google.com/> ← Duh

<https://www.facebook.com/> ← You're probably already on this one right now!

<http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html> ← This is the very first website!

<http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/> ← This one's really cool. I highly recommend checking this out later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Front End Web Dev vs Back End Web Dev

We usually make the distinction between the **front end** and the **back end** of a site or web app.

The **front end** of a site or web app is sometimes referred to as the **client**. It's the bit that's actually shown and stored on your computer - usually some HTML to show you specific content that you requested, CSS to style that content and make it readable and pretty, and JavaScript to provide interaction on the page and further communicate with the **back end** of a site or web app.

The **back end** of a site or web application is sometimes referred to as the **server**. It's stored on a large machine in a datacenter somewhere, and runs a bunch of complicated code that _serves_ up web pages across the internet, as well as communicates with clients/web pages that want more information.

With complex web apps (Facebook, Bloomberg), the line between the front and back end is pretty fuzzy!

We're only going to focus on the **front end** in this class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Front End Web Dev vs Back End Web Dev

Let's dive a bit deeper on the very first web site: <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html>

The first site is pretty simple. You can click links, which take you to other pages on the site, but that's about it.

The **front end** of this site consists only of HTML (content) - it doesn't have any CSS (styling) or JavaScript (interaction and communication).

There isn't much going on with the **back end** of this site - when you click a link, the computer that the site is hosted on "serves a new page" and that's it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Front End Web Dev vs Back End Web Dev

Let's dive a bit deeper on Google: <https://www.google.com/>

Google _appears_ to be pretty simple - you can put your search in the text box, and it starts doing things.

That's **interaction**, and there's also **communication** happening with the computers that do the "indexing" of the internet (your personal computer isn't searching the entire internet every time you Google something).

The front end of Google is pretty complex - lots of HTML (content), CSS (styling), and Javascript (interaction and communication).

The back end of Google is unbelievably complex. Many, _many_ things happen on Google's servers every time you make a search.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why should I be a Web Developer?

**Everyone needs a website.** Really! Even you!

Web developers can work at just about any company.

Web developers can also do consulting or freelancing!

It's easy to work remotely as a web developer.

You can work at all levels of the "stack" - you can work on the UI on the front end, the APIs on the back end, or a blend of both!

And, of course: <https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/software-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm>

_Software Engineers vs Web Developers: don't let people tell you that because you're a web developer, you're not a real software engineer. They do the same thing, just at different levels of an application._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What's it like being a Web Developer?

## At a company or "shop" (larger consulting company):

- Working within an **interdisciplinary team** (web developers, designers, backend engineers, project/product leads, possibly ops and testers)
- 80% heads-down or collaborative coding
- 20% meetings - "standups", meeting with product owners or clients
- Projects are chosen by product leads or clients
- **Pays well**, scales moderately well with experience

## Freelancing or consulting:

- **Working independently** (have to manage design, frontend, sometimes backend, and deployment)
- 80% heads-down coding or designing
- 20% meeting with clients, getting feedback on designs, prototypes, progress
- **Projects are chosen by you** - can adjust for current workload and desired rate
- Pays okay, but scales really well with experience, referrals, and portfolio work

# Let's Make a Website!

> But wait, can't I just use Wordpress/Squarespace/Wix/stuff like that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# On Wordpress/Squarespace/Wix/stuff like that

![Cookie dough in a tube](http://www.tablespoon.com/-/media/Images/Articles/PostImages/2014/07/2014-07-31-cookie-pies-1-680x384.jpg?la=en) ![Cookie dough from scratch](http://media2.onsugar.com/files/2014/05/08/770/n/1922195/73ff092a944d31bb_shutterstock_161855897.xxxlarge_2x.jpg)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# On Wordpress/Squarespace/Wix/stuff like that

There's a couple reasons that I prefer building sites by hand, vs sites with a site builder:

- Sites made with a site builder are **huge**

  - <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html> - 2.4 KB = 2,400 bytes
  - <https://hoff.tech/> - 478 KB = 478,000 bytes
  - <http://www.squarespace.com/> - 9.3 MB = 9,300,000
  - The first website on the internet is 0.02581% the size of Squarespace's landing page, and loads almost 4000x as fast.
  - A great talk on "page weight": <http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm>

- You learn more about the **fundamentals of the internet** by building sites by hand

  - How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work, and how they work together
  - How browsers and servers work
  - Site builders abstract this all away

- Sites built by hand are **easier to customize and extend**

  - "Can we make this button a different color when you hover over it?"
  - "Can we have a modal pop up when you click the button?"
  - "Can this video automatically play when the modal pops up? I don't have it on youtube yet."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's Make a Website!

Okay, for reals this time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Atom

First, download Atom: <https://atom.io/>

Atom is a **text editor**

Text files only contain **characters** (mostly just letters and numbers) - no text formatting

_(if you have a text editor you prefer, use that! I just like Atom)_

Alternatives include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Notepad++

_(Why not Visual Studio or Eclipse?)_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Next

Make a folder for your site

Put it wherever you want on your computer. (Your `Desktop` is a great destination any time of year!)

Open Atom, and make a new file.

(`Cmd-N` on a Mac, `Ctrl-N` on a PC)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Then

Put the following text in your new file:

```
<h1>asdfasdfasdf</h1>
```

Save your file in your new folder

Name it `index.html`.

Double-click the file that you just saved

It should open your web browser...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](http://i.imgur.com/0tlqT2F.gif)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tags

```
<h1>asdfasdfasdf</h1>
```

We just used something called a **tag** to tell the browser how to render our page.

`h1` stands for Heading 1\. It's generally used to indicate the visible title of a page.

`asdfasdfasdf` is the text that we wanted to render as a Heading 1.

`<h1>` marks the point that we want to start making text a Heading 1.

`</h1>` marks the point that we want to stop making the text a Heading 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Try switching it up

Edit your file, and replace your `h1` tags:

```
<p>asdfasdfasdf</p>
```

What happens?

Don't forget to "reload" your browser!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to Learn Web Development

- Look stuff up on the internet
- Make stuff
- Repeat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# While we're still here:

With our remaining time, you can work on the assignment for tonight, ask more questions, or try this short lab below!

## Use some more tags!

Try creating a short "About me" site. Show it off, if you want!

(this is just an informal in-class assignment - no need to submit it later!)

Try out these tags:

- `<p>`
- `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>...`
- `<ol>, <ul>, <li>`
- `<strong>, <em>`
- `<a>` ← can you make this point to another page of yours?
- `<img>`

Stuck? Remember "How to Learn Web Development"!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For tonight:

- Complete the assignment on the @classbot on Slack (`submit 0 http://some-url-here.example.com`)
- Sign up for Treehouse [using this link](http://referrals.trhou.se/kenhoff2)
- Sign up for a [free Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/) (should be able to just use a google account)
- Complete the readings for next time (`readings 1`)
- Message @dannywalsh on Slack with your Enrollment Agreement and to get your Spark Membership set up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Excelsior! 🚀
