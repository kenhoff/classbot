# Projects recap

- URL to your project shown on your "report card" at the end of the course - cool to show off to clients & employers

## Project 1: Portfolio Page - Session 4

Run `readings 4` to get a list of example portfolio pages.

## Project 2: Client Project - Session 9

Run `readings 9` to get a list of clients that might be interested in having work done for them!

# Forms and Buttons

There's a whole group of tags focused on helping the user interact with the page - `<form>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, and more - they can be styled and manipulated just like any other elements.

Forms usually interact with a "Back End" - user adding email address to a mailing list, or changing some profile information.

When we build our "Quote of the day" app, we'll run some JavaScript to communicate with a server and change the page whenever a `<button>` is clicked.

Because we won't really get to interaction and communication until the second half of the course, I'd recommend revisiting these tags once we have a better understanding of JavaScript.

# `<img>`

`<img>` tags have some things called **attributes**!

Here's a couple attributes that we've seen so far:

`src`

`alt`

`height`, `width` ‚Üê what happens if you leave out one of these?

what about `style`?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `<a>`

Here's a couple common `<a>` tag attributes:

`href` - can have absolute and relative paths

what if we set it to `#section1`?

`target` - what are the possible values for target?

what's the difference between `_blank` and `_self`?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# HTML tag attributes

Every tag can have **attributes**!

There are **global** attributes, and there are **element** attributes.

**Global** attributes are attributes that can be placed on any tag - things like `id`, `class`, and `style`

List of global attributes: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes>

**Element** attributes are specific to certain tags - things like `src`, `alt`, and `href`

Element attributes: <http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp>,

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What about the `<p>` tag?

What attributes does it have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setting the width and height of something

Have to use the `style` attribute!

`<h1 style="width:100px">this h1 is 100 pixels wide</h1>`

`<p style="height:200px">this p is 200 pixels tall</p>`

`<div style="width:150px;height:150px">this div is 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall</div>`

# Figuring out what styles are applied to a tag

To see the styles and attributes of an element, use the "Inspect element" tool

The little nested boxes on the right tell you more about the dimensions of your element - `margin`, `border`, `padding`, `height` and `width`

On the left you have a list of all the style **sources**, what styles they're applying, and if any of those styles are being _overridden_ by other styles.

In the lower right, you have **computed styles** - the styles actually applied to the element, after all of the styles are overridden.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Still have your "about me" page? Try adding some of these tags and styles:

Tags:

- `<img>` ‚Üê sourced from somewhere on the internet
- `<img>` ‚Üê sourced from somewhere on your own domain/filesystem
- `<br>`, `<hr>`
- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- `<title>` ‚Üê tricky! where does it go???
- `<div>`, `<span>` ‚Üê what the whaaat?
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` (my favorite tag in the world)

Styles:

- `color`
- `background-color`
- `border`
- `border-color`
- `font-style`
- `font-size`
- `font-family`
- `display` ‚Üê what's the difference between inline and block? what about flex?
