Session 2: **The Wrath of Session**

HTML tags & attributes, the `style` attribute

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Projects!

Over the course of the next 10 weeks, I'm going to have you complete 4 different projects.

You can present your project to the class, if you want! Definitely not required.

Just like all of the other assignments, these aren't formally "due" anytime.

These projects won't be formally graded at all, but they'll be included in your "report card" at the end of the class. They're also really cool to show off to potential clients and employers!

-   **Project 1: Portfolio Site**
    -   Optional presentations: Session 4
-   **Project 2: Client Project**
    -   Optional presentations: Session 9
-   **Project 3: TSA Randomizer**
    -   Optional presentations: Session 14
-   **Project 4: Random Quote App**
    -   Optional presentations: Session 19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment 4, Project 1: Portfolio Site

For your first project, I'd like you to create a **simple** portfolio site. Nothing too fancy!

You can put whatever you'd like on it! You can include things like:

-   Your name
-   Where you went to school
-   What you're currently working on, or what you'd like to work on (internship, job, freelance, whatever)
-   Any projects that you're proud of, or that you're currently working on
-   Pictures of your cat
-   Pictures of your hometown
-   Pictures of your sweet snowboard flip
-   Your contact information

Really, anything you want! I'm not "grading" these. You can submit them whenever you want.

If you'd like to see a couple examples of other portfolios, you can check them out on the [readings for session 4](/readings/4). Some of these are pretty advanced! I just want you to create something simple that you're comfortable with.

A couple things:

-   You'll submit a link to your portfolio for assignment 4. That means that you'll just run `submit 4 http://my-awesome-portfolio.site44.com/index.html` on @classbot.
-   Whatever URL you submit, please try to keep that live for as long as possbile, during and after the class. It gets included on your report card, and it's nice to be able to show it to potential employers and clients.
-   Keep updating it! The best portfolios are one that show that you're always growing.
-   If you'd like to present yours, you can do so on Session 4. Presenting is totally optional!

# Attributes!

We learned a bit about attributes last time - they're things that we can attach to tags to change how they work.

To write an attribute, we include it in the **opening tag** of an element.

```html
<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>
```

In this case, the **value** of the `href` attribute is `http://google.com`. Values (generally) need to be wrapped in quotation marks!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Element-specific attributes

**Element-specific** attributes only appear on certain tags.

For example, `href` is an element-specific attribute, because it only shows up on `<a>` tags.

`src` and `alt` are also element-specific attributes, because it only shows up on `<img>` tags.

Usually, you can find whatever attributes are available on a tag by googling [html img tag attributes](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+image+tag+attributes) or similar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Anchor tag attributes

We covered this a little bit last time, but the `href` attribute is the important bit of an `<a>` tag.

We can also include a `target` attribute to change the behavior a little bit:

```html
<a href="contact.html" target="_self">Contact Me</a>
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Image tag attributes

Also covered a bit last time - the `src` attribute is the URL of the image, and the `alt` attribute is displayed when we have a broken link.

What does the `title` attribute do in this case?

```html
<img src="stupid.gif" alt="broken link :(" title="Let's always be stupid, forever!" />
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Global attributes

**Global** attributes are attributes that can be placed on **any** tag - text, images, links, anything!

The most common global attributes we'll see are `id`, `class`, and `style`.

List of all global attributes: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `id` attribute

Any element can have an `id` attribute.

Next session, we'll learn to use `id` as a CSS selector, but for the time being, we can use it with `<a>` tags!

This is also sometimes called a URL **fragment**.

```html
<h1>
	table of contents
</h1>
<p>
	<a href="#section1">section 1</a>
	<a href="#section2">section 2</a>
</p>
<h1 id="section1">section 1</h1>
<p>
	Around the world around the world. Around the world, around the world around the world. Around the world. Around the world around the world. Around the world. Around the world around the world around the world, around the world. Around the world. Around

```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `class` attribute

We'll learn more about the `class` attribute next session, when we talk about CSS selectors.

For the time being, you just need to know that it's another global attribute.

```html
<div class="sidebar">
	<ul>
		<li>home</li>
		<li>about</li>
		<li>contact</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="maincontent">
	<h1>article</h1>
	<p>lorem ipsum blah blah blah</p>
</div>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The style attribute

Now we're getting somewhere!

```html
<p style="color: blue;">
	Dude!
</p>
<p style="background-color: red;">
	Sweet!
</p>
```

There are four parts to a "style" within the `style` attribute:

-   the name of the style (`color`, `background-color`)
-   the colon, followed by an optional space
-   the value of the style (depends on the style, but for colors you can use things like [`red`, `blue`, or `chartreuse`](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp))
-   followed by a semicolon

You can string multiple styles together in a single `style` tag!

```html
<p style="color: blue; background-color: red;">
	No, really, what does it say?
</p>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What's a style?

A "style" (not the style attribute) is a bit of information attached to an element that tells the browser how to display that element.

```html
<p style="color: blue; background-color: red;">
	No, really, what does it say?
</p>
```

Copy the `<p>` element above to your own page and open it in a browser (locally is fine, just double-click the `.html` file)

Then, pop open your browser's developer tools and **Inspect** the element. (right click the element on the page > Inspect). Look for the **Styles** tab.

You should be able to find something like this:

```css
element.style {
    color: blue;
    background-color: red;
}
```

Great! This means that we've applied two **styles** directly to the element - the `color` style and the `background-color` style.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Seeing all the styles on the element

Find and click on the **Computed** section in the browser dev tools.

This shows us **all** the styles that are currently being applied to our element, including the ones inside the `style` attribute.

When we start writing CSS, and start making big sweeping style changes, we're going to have **some styles conflicting with other styles**.

For example, if we want all paragraphs to be dark text with a white background, but if we want all paragraphs in our navigation section to be white text with a dark background, then there's going to be some CSS **overriding** happening.

We can debug this using the **Computed** section in the browser dev tools. We'll revisit it during our CSS selector adventures.

> _In the meantime, this is called "specificity and the CSS cascade." Not something you really need to know in-depth, but it's good to at least know what it's called._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Inheritance

Some styles on parent elements get passed down to child elements!

It generally follows common sense which styles inherit (color, font stuff) and which don't (borders, background images).

If you need an explicit list, you can check out the ["offical" list here](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html). (if someone finds a better list, please let me know!)

# Stuff for tonight:

-   Complete [assignment 2](/assignments/2)
    -   I'd recommend creating separate pages for each assignment, and then just submitting that specific page (e.g. `submit 2 http://notajetski.site44.com/assignment2.html`)
-   Complete [readings 3](/readings/3)
