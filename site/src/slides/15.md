# Better Site Hosting - [site44](http://www.site44.com/)

I found [site44](http://www.site44.com/)!

[site44](http://www.site44.com/) lets you put your site in a Dropbox folder. Every time that you change something in the Dropbox folder, it redeploys your live site on the internet. **Mathematical!**

I probably should have had you using this since the beginning, but I didn't know about it then. Sorry!

It's got a 30-day trial, and after that it's $5/mo. Not required to use it, but if you'd like, it might be easier!

# Tonight: jQuery!

jQuery is a library (a bunch of JavaScript that other people wrote that we can use) that provides a bunch of handy-dandy functions to make our life easier.

jQuery provides functions for us to manipulate the page, listen for user interaction, and make requests across the network - just like JavaScript, but much easier!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Including jQuery on our site

Just include it via CDN:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
</html>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using jQuery on our site

Let's make sure that we've included jQuery on our site correctly.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
			console.log($);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

If you **have** included jQuery correctly, it should log a function to the console.

If you **haven't** included jQuery correctly, it'll log something like `"Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined"` to the console.

Remember to put any `<script>`s that you write at the **bottom** of the `<body>` tag!

> _Some jQuery tutorials may have you put your `<script>` inside the `<head>` tag, then use `$(document).ready()` or something like that. I don't really like doing it this way, because it's not as straightforward, but do whatever works for you._

# Using jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript on your site

We're going to use the first example from <https://jquery.com/>.

Let's say that we wanted to change all `<button>`s on the page with the class of `continue` to have the text `Next Step...`.

## Using only vanilla JavaScript:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<button>Just a regular button without a class</button>
		<button class="continue">A button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<button class="continue">Another button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<script>
			var buttons = document.getElementsByTagName("button");
			for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
				if (buttons[i].className.includes("continue")) {
					buttons[i].innerHTML = "Next Step...";
				}
			}
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

## Using jQuery:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<button>Just a regular button without a class</button>
		<button class="continue">A button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<button class="continue">Another button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<script>
			$("button.continue").html("Next Step...");
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

# jQuery next steps

We're going to learn more about jQuery selectors and methods next session!

In the meantime, you can find literally everything that jQuery does at <https://api.jquery.com/>.

Copy and paste with reckless abandon!
