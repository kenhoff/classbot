jQuery 201: including jQuery on your site

Recently, in web dev news:

More dumb fun web stuff
I am terrible at color. (all of my stuff is usually in grayscale)

So this is pretty helpful!

Tonight
on Front End Web Development:


More Lorem Ipsum App!

Anyone want to show off progress on Lorem Ipsum?

What to submit
Assignment 14: Submit the subject/theme of your Lorem Ipsum generator. No need to build anything yet!
Example: submit 14 https://www.daftpunk.com/

Assignment 15: Submit your final, complete Lorem Ipsum generator. Create a separate Firebase (or public site) and keep it live! (just so we can show it off at the end of the class)
Example: submit 15 https://harderbetterfasteripsum.hoff.tech/

And now:
Code snippets that you might find useful

Selecting an element at random from an array
var myArray = ["these", "are", "a", "bunch", "of", "strings"];
var randomElement = myArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * myArray.length)];
console.log(randomElement); // a random element from the array


“Concatenating” a string
var string1 = "daft";
var string2 = "punk";
var string3 = string1.concat(string2);
console.log(string3); // daftpunk
// or!
string3 = string1 + string2; // daftpunk



Do something while there are less than 5 characters in a string
var myString = "" // an 'empty' string
while (myString.length < 5) {
	myString = myString.concat("a")
}
console.log(myString); // aaaaa



How to create a brand new <p> tag with text in it
$('<p></p>').text(“yayyyyyyy!”);
// this actually creates a new HTML element!

How to append a brand new <p> tag with text in it to another tag
var myNewPTag = $('<p></p>').text(“yayyyyy!”);
$(".myContent").append(myNewPTag);
// results in...
<div class=“myContent”>
	<p>yayyyyy!</p>
</div>


Bonus: “joining” an array of strings
myArrayOfStrings = ["around", "the", "world"];
joinedString = myArrayOfStrings.join(" "); // use a space character
console.log(joinedString); // "around the world"

When you realize that web development is your life, forever:

Tonight: jQuery!

What is jQuery?
jQuery is a library (a bunch of JavaScript that other people wrote that we can use) that provides a bunch of handy-dandy functions to make our life easier.

jQuery provides functions for us to select elements, manipulate HTML and CSS, and make requests across the network - just like JavaScript, but much easier!

Installing jQuery
Just include it via CDN:

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.2.min.js"></script>

Don’t forget, this should go in <head>!


Including jQuery on your site
It can be a tremendous pain in the ass.

General rule:
Put the <script> tag to the jQuery CDN in <head>.

Put the <script> tag to myScript.js as the last element of <body>. Don’t worry about any other initialization or $(document).ready() crap.

Literally everything that jQuery does
https://api.jquery.com/

Copy and paste with reckless abandon!

Selecting elements using jQuery
Just like CSS!

$(“div”) ← selects all divs
$(“.section”) ← selects all elements with class “section”
$(“#navbar”) ← selects all elements with id “navbar”

Spoiler Alert!
(we’re gonna build a spoiler alert
 thing today)

https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/i2mg6/attention_we_now_have_a_new_spoilertagging_system/

.hide()
$(“.spoiler”).hide()

(should probably call this as soon as we load the page!)

.show()
$(“.spoiler”).show()

Wait, we don’t want to do this right away! We only want to show it when we click on “reveal spoiler”!

.click()
$(".revealSpoiler").click(function() {
$(".spoiler").show();
});



Literally everything else that jQuery does
https://api.jquery.com/

Copy and paste with reckless abandon!

Side note - the one developer I look up to the most is Zach Holman.
All of the stuff that he’s got on his blog is worth reading - highly recommend checking it out.
