On August 24th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!

Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects:

-   Portfolio (assignment 4)
-   Client Project (assignment 9)
-   Coin Flipping App (assignment 14)
-   Social Network Front End (assignment 19)

Remember to check your grades with `grades` on @classbot!

Remember to create separate site44 apps for your projects so that potential clients and employers can see them!

# The Final Project!

For your final project, I'm going to have you create the front end to the Spark Front End Web Development Social Network.

All of the API documentation is up at <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/>.

The Spark Front End Web Development Social Network lets all of the students create new posts, and view all the posts in the Social Network.

You'll need at least 2 pages:

-   a main page which shows all the posts in the Social Network (the news feed)
-   a page that lets you post to the Social Network.

The main page (probably your `index.html`) should show all the posts in the Social Network, from most recent to least recent. Each post has some content, an author, and a date/time that it was created.

Your posting page should have a text box where you can punch in some content, and then a button that lets you create a post on the Social Network. **Your posting page should be secret! Only you should know the URL for it, otherwise other people will be able to post to your profile.**

Your `profile_id` is just your slack username.

You'll need a `profile_secret` in order to post to the Social Network. I'll direct message you your `profile_secret` in Slack.

A couple notes:

-   Don't share your `profile_secret` with anyone, and don't share the URL of your posting page with anyone, or else they'll be able to post to your profile as you!
-   Don't put your `profile_secret` anywhere in your `index.html`, and don't include it in any scripts that are included in your `index.html` - otherwise, I'll be able to open that script and find it.
-   Feel free to go a little nuts with the API, but use common sense. The API can pretty easily handle 1000s of posts, but it doesn't include any content validation or throttling - if you DDoS the API, I'm going to be sad :(
-   Ask for help! I just wrote this thing, so if something's not so clear, I can deffo make it clearer, have better documentation, etc.

# Tonight: jQuery!

jQuery is a **library** (a bunch of JavaScript that other people wrote that we can use) that provides a bunch of handy-dandy functions to make our life easier.

jQuery provides functions for us to manipulate the page, listen for user interaction, and make requests across the network - just like JavaScript, but much easier!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Including jQuery on our site

Just include it via CDN:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
</html>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using jQuery on our site

Let's make sure that we've included jQuery on our site correctly.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

console.log($);
```

If you **have** included jQuery correctly, it should log a function to the console.

If you **haven't** included jQuery correctly, it'll log something like `"Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined"` to the console.

Remember to put any `<script>`s that you write at the **bottom** of the `<body>` tag!

> _Some jQuery tutorials may have you put your `<script>` inside the `<head>` tag, then use `$(document).ready()` or something like that. I don't really like doing it this way, because it's not as straightforward, but do whatever works for you._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The jQuery function, `$`

Remember how to include jQuery on your site?

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
			console.log($);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

When `$` is logged to the console, it should say something like `function (selectors, context) { ... }`.

`$` is a **function** - that means that we can "call" it, just like `sayHello()` or `addTwoNumbers(firstNumber, secondNumber)`.

Let's try calling `$` without any _arguments_, and see what the result is:

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
			console.log($);
			var result = $();
			console.log(result);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

I don't actually know what happens! I haven't tested this. What happens?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using jQuery "selectors"

Generally, whenever we call `$`, we want to provide an _argument_.

The function `$` takes a **string** as the first argument.

The string argument should be a **selector**, just like we use in CSS. That means that you can select elements by `tag`, `.class` or `#id`!

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="kanyeQuotes">
			<p class="profoundQuote">
				My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
			</p>
			<p id="waterBottleQuote">
				I hate when I'm on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.
			</p>
			<p class="profoundQuote">
				Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<script>
			// we'll select three different sets of objects - just comment out the lines that you don't want
			console.log($("p"));
			console.log($(".profoundQuote"));
			console.log($("#waterBottleQuote"));
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

Don't forget! Here's a list of all possible CSS Selectors: <http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp>

jQuery supports all those selectors, and some more: <http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/>

> _`$` takes a second argument called `context`, but we generally don't use it. It's handy if you need to use another selector on a set of already-selected elements (sort of like "nested selectors")._
>
> _Here's a fun jQuery line that I wrote last week: `$("td:contains('Time Played') ~ td", $("#competitive-play .career-stats-section .js-stats").slice(0, 1)).text();`_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# jQuery methods

> _Aside: whenever I say "methods", I'm basically saying "functions"._

jQuery has a lot of **methods**! You can see the full list of them here: <http://api.jquery.com/>

_You will never be able to learn all of these methods_. There may be some that you memorize after you use them a couple dozen times, but for the most part, **you should always go look at the documentation**.

**jQuery has some of the best documentation I've seen on the internet**. Some of the methods have documentation with _dozens_ of real-world examples, which you should _copy-and-paste with reckless abandon_!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using jQuery methods

Calling jQuery methods is similar to calling Browser API methods, like `document.getElementsByTagName("p")` or `window.alert()`.

To call jQuery methods, first, call the `$` with a selector, then call the method on the result.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="kanyeQuotes">
			<p id="#profound">
				Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<script>
			var result = $("#profound").html();
			console.log(result);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

> _It's possible to "chain" jQuery methods, so you can call any jQuery method on the **result** of any other jQuery method. You can build big hairy jQuery calls like `$(this).find("li a").eq(2).text().replace("foo", "bar");`_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting and Setting with jQuery methods

It's possible to both **get** (read) and **set** (write) the contents or properties of HTML elements _using a single method_.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="kanyeQuotes">
			<p id="#profound">
				Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on.
			</p>
		</div>
		<script>
			var result = $("#profound").html();
			console.log(result);
			$("#profound").html("My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.");
			var result = $("#profound").html();
			console.log(result);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

> _What's the difference between `.html()` and `.text()`?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Using jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript on your site

We're going to use the first example from <https://jquery.com/>.

Let's say that we wanted to change all `<button>`s on the page with the class of `continue` to have the text `Next Step...`.

## Using only vanilla JavaScript:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<body>
		<button>Just a regular button without a class</button>
		<button class="continue">A button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<button class="continue">Another button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

var buttons = document.getElementsByTagName("button");
for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
	if (buttons[i].className.includes("continue")) {
		buttons[i].innerHTML = "Next Step...";
	}
}
```

## Using jQuery:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<body>
		<button>Just a regular button without a class</button>
		<button class="continue">A button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<button class="continue">Another button with the "continue" class, waiting to be changed...</button>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$("button.continue").html("Next Step...");
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# jQuery next steps

We're going to learn more about jQuery selectors and methods next session!

In the meantime, you can find literally everything that jQuery does at <https://api.jquery.com/>.

Copy and paste with reckless abandon!
