On December 14th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!

Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects:

-   Portfolio (assignment 4)
-   Client Project (assignment 9)
-   Coin Flipping App (assignment 14)
-   Social Network Front End (assignment 19)

Remember to check your grades with `grades` on @classbot!

Remember to create separate site44 apps for your projects so that potential clients and employers can see them!

# Exit interviews

Danny wants to grab 15 minutes with each of you sometime after the class ends to do an exit interview!

Book him sometime after December 7th here: <https://dannyw.youcanbook.me>

You can give feedback about Spark, the class, and most importantly, me!

# The Social Network Front End Project

For your final project, I'm going to have you create the **front end** to the Spark Front End Web Development Social Network.

All of the students in the class are on the Social Network! You can create new posts, and everyone else in the Social Network can see those posts.

For your front end,  you'll need at least 2 pages:

-   a **main page** which shows all the posts in the Social Network
    -   The main page (probably your `index.html`) should show all the posts in the Social Network, from most recent to least recent. Each post has some content, an author, and a date/time that it was created.
-   a **secret posting page** that lets you post to the Social Network
    -   Your posting page should have a text box where you can punch in some content, and then a button that lets you create a post on the Social Network. **Your posting page should be secret! Only you should know the URL for it, otherwise other people will be able to post to your profile.**

You'll need to make requests to the API to create and get posts on the Social Network. All of the API documentation is up at <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/>.

Some notes:

-   Your `profile_id` is just your Slack username.
-   You'll need a `profile_secret` in order to post to the Social Network. I'll direct message you your `profile_secret` in Slack.
-   Don't share your `profile_secret` with anyone, and don't share the URL of your posting page with anyone, or else they'll be able to post to your profile as you!
-   Don't put your `profile_secret` anywhere in your `index.html`, and don't include it in any scripts that are included in your `index.html` - otherwise, I'll be able to open that script and find it.
-   Use common sense when creating a post on the Social Network. I'm not moderating it at all, but keep it PG-13 please.
-   Use common sense when using the Social Network API. It can pretty easily handle 1000s of posts, but it doesn't have any restrictions on the amount of posts that you can create, or how often you create posts. If you write a `for` loop that does nothing but create spam posts all day, then I'm going to be sad :(

Logistics:

-   Remember to create a separate site44 site, and keep it up after the class ends so that potential clients and employers can see it!
-   Submit your site44 site for [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   This info is available on [readings 19](/readings/19) and [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   Ask for help! I just wrote this thing, so if something's not so clear, I can definitely improve it. Let me know!

# HTTP requests with jQuery

Time to bust out those text editors!

# GET requests with jQuery recap

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts",
	method: "GET"
}).done(function(data) {
	// the request has succeeded
	console.log(data);
}).fail(function(jqXHR, status, error) {
	// the request has failed
	console.log(error);
});
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# URL parameters

Sometimes we can select which data we want by changing various **URL parameters** - basically just various bits in the URL to select different objects in the system.

For example, to get all of the profiles in the system, we can make a GET request to the `/profiles` API route:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/profiles",
	method: "GET"
}).done(function(data) {
	// the request has succeeded
	console.log(data);
}).fail(function(jqXHR, status, error) {
	// the request has failed
	console.log(error);
});
```

But, if we only wanted to get Ken's profile (and we didn't want to filter through all profiles in the system), we could just make a GET request to the `/profiles/ken` API route:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/profiles/ken",
	method: "GET"
}).done(function(data) {
	// the request has succeeded
	console.log(data);
}).fail(function(jqXHR, status, error) {
	// the request has failed
	console.log(error);
});
```

Try changing the name on the URL (`/profiles/ken`) and see what comes up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Query parameters

There's one more way that you can specify data when making a GET request - query parameters.

Normally, you can just tack query parameters onto the end of a URL by using `?` and putting `=` between each key and value, like this:

```
https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts?profile=ken
```

(this will get all the posts made by the user with the profile "ken")

If you want to put multiple query parameters, you'll have to separate them with an `&`:

```
https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts?profile=ken&someotherparameter=asdfasdfasdf`
```

Thankfully, jQuery provides a somewhat easier way to do this with the `data` option.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts",
	method: "GET",
	data: {
		profile: "ken"
	}
}).done(function(data) {
	// the request has succeeded
	console.log(data);
}).fail(function(jqXHR, status, error) {
	// the request has failed
	console.log(error);
});
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# POST requests with jQuery

Remember, we use POST requests any time we want to **create** or **update** data.

jQuery's `$.ajax()` documentation: <https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/>

The only difference between a GET and POST request is the `method` field on our `$.ajax()` call.

Generally, POST requests will need to include some kind of data payload, but it's possible for them not to. (POST request payloads don't work the same way that query parameters do in GET requests - in POST requests, they're not part of the URL, but they're still sent as part of the request body.)

Let's post a new quote to Ken's profile on the Social Network! Find the "Creating a new post" section on <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/#getting-started>.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="myscript.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// myscript.js

$.ajax({
	url: "https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/api/posts",
	method: "POST",
	data: {
		profile_id: "ken",
		profile_secret: "ken's super secret profile_secret",
		content: "Mathematical!"
	}
}).done(function(data) {
	// the request has succeeded
	console.log(data);
}).fail(function(response) {
	// the request has failed
	console.log(response.responseText);
});
```

This obviously won't work for you, unless you have my profile_secret :) try changing `profile_id` and `profile_secret` and see what happens!
