--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# No class on July 4th! (that's next session! Monday!)

I'd still recommend doing the readings, if you can. I'll include lots of links to free, prebuilt HTML themes that are available for you to download and customize for your clients, so you don't have to build everything yourself!

And there is still an assignment. But it's easy. You can hate me later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Client projects!

For assignment 9, you'll submit a site that you made for a client!

If you've already got a client in mind, great!

If you don't have a client yet, that's alright! You can get a list of some potential clients by having a look at `readings 9`. Keep checking it - I add more people every so often!

During session 9, you can present your client project if you want!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Client project FAQ

**Q: Do they _have_ to pay me?**

A: Nope! They don't have to. Part of the class work and all.

**Q: Are they _allowed_ to pay me?**

A: Of course! _(but make sure it's a small amount, otherwise you'll have to sign paperwork and stuff)_

**Q: What if I can't get it done in time for session 9?**

A: That's okay! Just be sure to get it done by the end of the course. The URL you submit is included as part of your report card!

**Q: Does the client have to use what I make?**

A: Nope - the client is under no obligation to publicly use your work. If they would like to, they totally can!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to find clients

For this class, you've either already got a client or will get in touch with someone on the list (remember, `readings 9` to get the list of clients) about their page. Hooray!

This advice mostly applies to people who are interested in doing freelance/consulting work, or would like to run a freelance/consulting shop.

To land clients in real life, you need to do 3 things:

1. Build a sales funnel/pipeline
2. Get clients into the funnel/pipeline
3. Move clients through the funnel/pipeline

In non-business-y terms, this equates to:

1. Keep track of all the potential clients that you talk to ([Trello](https://trello.com/) is great!)
2. Talk to potential clients (go out and network, talk to every single person that you know and say that you're looking for work, hand out business cards)
3. Actually do web development for clients

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to work with a client

1. Meet with the client, gather requirements and feedback
2. Build something
3. Repeat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 1: Meet with the client, gather requirements and feedback

First, arrange a meeting with your client - face-to-face is best, but video chat should be fine. You can set up a phone call as a last resort, but you won't be able to read body language or emotion as well.

> _Absolute easiest video chat software is <http://appear.in/>, but Hangouts and Skype work too._

In the meeting, you want to find out a couple things:

1. Find out what they're currently using as a web presence. Facebook page? Twitter? Tumblr? Wordpress? What do they like about it, and what don't they like about it?
2. What do they want their web presence to accomplish? To show people dates and times? Menus? Portfolio projects? Who is their site for? Customers? Potential employers?
3. What other sites do they like or are inspired by? There's lots of great reference material from similar businesses, competitors or freelancers.

These kinds of questions help determine what kind of content, layout, and styling you should use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 2: Build something

Start small! Get to something demoable ASAP. Deploy a draft on Firebase, so that you've got something the client can take a look at as you go.

Placeholder images, text, all totally fine. You'll iterate on this as you go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Step 3: Repeat

It's scary as shit showing off something that you've made - it's gonna feel half-assed, and look kinda lumpy, and it's probably held together with popsicle sticks and glue, but show it to your client anyway.

Your client will like some stuff and not like other stuff. **Take notes!**

Now you've got some concrete, tangible feedback on a concrete, tangible site - go improve it, and do it all over again!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Things that you will probably be able to do

**Landing pages** - pages with one or two sections. Mostly consist of links to other sites.

**Single-page sites** - pages with several sections. Consist of info, modals, links, etc.

**Multi-page sites** - several different pages, each with one or two sections of dedicated info. Main page has links to other sites, and other pages may have links too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Things that might be too much work

**Blogs & product pages** - these are generally updated pretty frequently. I'd stick with links to Medium or Shopify.

**Shopping carts, checkouts** - This requires significant backend coding. If they need something like that, I'd recommend Shopify.

**Contact forms** - also requires some backend coding; e.g. a server to actually manage and send emails. Stick to links to social media.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assets that you will need from your client

**Images** - product images, team photos (group and individual), background images, office images

**Text** - Slogans, product descriptions, customer testimonials

**Links to social media** - Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Medium, Instagram

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Embeds

Embeddable elements can make your life easier!

- Google Calendar (<https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/41207?hl=en>)
- Twitter timelines (<https://dev.twitter.com/web/embedded-timelines>)
- YouTube videos (<https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en>)

They usually have some options to customize them - poke around in the documentation!

Google around to find other things that you can embed.

If you want to embed something specific, and they don't have embeddable elements, then you might be able to use <http://embed.ly/> to do it. Ask me if you need help.

# Setting up your Firebase app with a custom URL

1. Buy a domain (I usually use [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/))
2. Go to the "Hosting" section on the Firebase app console
3. Click the "Connect Custom Domain" button
4. Add your domain (just `my-domain-name.com` - no `http` or `www`)
5. To "verify ownership", head into your Namecheap dashboard, and click "Manage" on the domain that you're trying to connect.
6. Find the "Host records" section on the dashboard for your domain.
7. Create two `TXT` records, each with the value specified in the Firebase popup.
8. While you wait for Firebase to validate the domain, sit back, relax, and watch some [Don't Hug Me I'm Scared](https://youtu.be/9C_HReR_McQ).
9. Reconsider every life decision that you have ever made.
10. Once Firebase has validated the domain, head back into the Namecheap host records for your domain.
11. Add the `CNAME` host records specified in the Firebase popup.
12. Test out your domain to see if it works!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What to submit for assignment 5

For assignment 5, I want you to submit a link to your client's existing site or web presence. This just gives us an idea of who your client is, and what life was like before you came in blew their minds!

If they don't already have a site, just submit anything that you can find on them - Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, anything that tells us a little bit about them.

For example, if I was doing some work for my friend Josh, I'd submit this to @classbot:

```
submit 5 https://soundcloud.com/joshuaduchene
```
