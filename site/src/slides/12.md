Session 12: **Into Darkness**

Javascript 103: objects and arrays

----

Recently, on Front End Web Development
Last Tuesday, I ran into some weird errors while working on Burlock:

(sorry for the clickbait title)

(poll time)

Spring Break was...

relaxing
a little...fuzzy
what break?

More dumb fun web stuff
Games only using javascript (no canvas!)

Also fun: Candy Box, Candy Box 2, and Cookie Clicker

Variables
A variable is like a box - you can put stuff in it, you can take stuff out of it, and you can read what’s in it. It can only hold one thing at a time.

var x = 1;			// assigning the number 1 to the variable x
console.log(x); 		// 1
var x = "a string";	// assigning the string "a string" to the variable x
console.log(x); 		// a string
var x = null;		// assigning nothing to the variable x
console.log(x); 		// null




Arrays
Arrays are just lists of elements (variables). Positions in arrays are referred to as indexes. Remember, arrays start at index 0!
var myArray = ["element 0", 12345, "element 2"] // can define multiple variable types in the same array
console.log(myArray); 					// ["element 0", 12345, "element 2"]
console.log(myArray[0]); 				// element 0
myArray[1] = "element 1"				// assigning the element at index 1 of myArray to the string "element 1"
console.log(myArray); 					// ["element 0", "element 1", "element 2"]
console.log(myArray.length); 				// 3



Objects
Objects are sort of like arrays, but use key-value pairs instead of indexes.
var myObject = {
	"key": "value",
	"key2": 12345
};
console.log(myObject); 		// { key: 'value', key2: 12345 }
console.log(myObject.key); 	// value
myObject.key2 = "anotherValue";
console.log(myObject.key2);	// anotherValue

Objects
Objects can be nested
myObject = {
	"key": "value"
	"key2": 12345,
	"anotherKey": {
		"whoa": "dude"
	}
}
Spoiler alert: technically, everything in JavaScript is an object!

Loops
Loops iterate over an array. There are lots of ways to do loops, but I prefer this one:
var myArray = ["element 0", 12345, "element 2"];
for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
	// first, var i = 0
	// then, do whatever's in the curly brackets, as long as i is less than myArray.length (which happens to be 3)
	// then, after each time that you do whatever's in the curly brackets, increment i by 1
	console.log(myArray[i]);
}
// element 0
// 12345
// element 2



A function is a set of instructions that you can run over and over again. They take arguments, and (optionally) return variables.
function addTwoNumbers(a, b) { 	// definining our function as addTwoNumbers
		return a + b 			// specifying the arguments that it takes as a, b
} 							// return the value of a + b
var result = addTwoNumbers(1, 2); 	// call the function addTwoNumbers, store the return value
console.log(result); 			// 3

Functions

But wait! There’s a gotcha.
Things get weird if you pass in an object or array (vs a number or string) to a function.

Functions will modify objects or arrays, even if you don’t explicitly return them.
(Functions won’t modify numbers or strings, unless you explicitly return them.)

This is called “pass by reference” for objects and arrays, vs “pass by value” for numbers and strings.
