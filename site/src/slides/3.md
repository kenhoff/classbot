# Inline styles recap

Remember, we apply **inline** styles directly to HTML elements, using the HTML `style` attribute:

```html
<h1 style="color: purple; font-size: 200%;">Rhombus!</h1>

<p style="background-color: beige; border-style: solid; border-width: 5px; border-color: green; height: 100px;">Shmow-zow!</p>
```

We can apply multiple styles by just putting them in a list. **Don't forget those semicolons!**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Internal Styles

**Internal** styles aren't included on individual elements (like **inline** styles with the `style` attribute), but instead are included on the HTML page.

At the top of your page, inside the `<head>` tag, you can use a `<style>` tag to include something called **CSS**:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: "Comic Sans MS", sans-serif;
        }

        h1 {
            color: red;
            text-decoration: underline;
            text-align: center;
        }

        img {
            border-style: solid;
            border-color: chartreuse;
            border-width: 5px;
        }

        p {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Ken's Site</h1>
    <img src="stupid.gif" />
    <p>
        Ken likes to do the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bike in the rain</li>
        <li>Eat burritos</li>
        <li>Play video games</li>
    </ul>
</body>

</html>
```

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What's CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that helps us style pages.

**CSS is different than HTML!** Whenever you have HTML `<style>` tags on a page (internal styles), everything **inside** those tags is CSS.

```html
<style>
    /* this is all CSS! */
    h1 {
        color: red;
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-align: center;
    }
</style>
```

(This means that you have two different languages, HTML and CSS, in the same file.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What's a CSS "rule"?

This whole thing is a CSS "rule":

```css
h1 {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-align: center;
}
```

CSS rules consist of a **selector** and a **declaration block**.

In this case, `h1` is the selector, and everything inside the curly brackets `{}` is the **declaration block**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What's a declaration block?

The second part is the easy part - we've already been declaring **styles** with our inline styles.

This is exactly the same thing! Style name, colon, style value, semicolon. Did I mention not to forget the semicolon?

Just put it all between curly brackets.

# What's a selector?

A CSS selector indicates **what elements we want to apply styles to**.

In this case, `h1` is our CSS selector.

```css
h1 {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-align: center;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tag selectors

One of the easiest uses of selectors is to select **all** HTML elements with a specific **tag** on a page.

This will apply the styles in the declaration block to **all** of the selected HTML elements.

From our first example, all of these use tag selectors to style all instances of various HTML elements.

```css
body {
    font-family: "Comic Sans MS", sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-align: center;
}

img {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: chartreuse;
    border-width: 5px;
}

p {
    color: blue;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The reference for **all** CSS selectors

I visit this page **a lot**.

If you want to figure out how to select all checkboxes that are checked, or select every other paragraph element, or select links that have already been visited, you can find it here.

<http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The "and" selector

I generally don't want to write two different rules to change all `<h1>`s and `<p>`s to the color red. Good code reuse and all.

```css
/*  
    don't do it this way!
    if you want to change the color of h1 and p later,
    you'll have to change it in two places instead of one.
*/
h1 {
    color: red;
}

p {
    color: red;
}
```

We can just use a comma in the selector to specify multiple types of tags.

```css
/* the right way: */
h1, p {
    color: red;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `id` selectors

Hey, remember that `id` global attribute? We can use that to select specific individual HTML elements.

To select an HTML element with a specific `id`, we just prefix the value of `id` with a `#`:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        #burritos {
            color: pink;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
        Ken likes to do the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bike in the rain</li>
        <li id="burritos">Eat burritos</li>
        <li>Play video games</li>
    </ul>
</body>

</html>
```

# However

**Don't put the same `id` on multiple elements.** `id` should be treated as a unique identifier, and only one element with a given `id` should exist on the page at any one time.

Want to style arbitrary groups of elements? Use `class`!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `class` selectors

Similar to `id` selectors, we can use `class` selectors to select specific elements.

The difference between `id` and `class`?

-   You can only have one `id` on an element.
-   You can have multiple `class`es on an element.
-   You should only have one specific `id` value assigned to a single element per page.
-   You can assign the same `class` to as many elements on a page as you want.

To select a specific `class` in a CSS selector, prefix the class with a `.` (period)

```html
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        .nerdy-stuff {
            background-color: black;
            color: LawnGreen;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
        Ken likes to do the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bike in the rain</li>
        <li class="nerdy-stuff">Play video games</li>
        <li>Eat burritos</li>
        <li class="nerdy-stuff">Make video games</li>
        <li>Play the ukulele</li>
    </ul>
</body>

</html>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The "child" and "direct child" selector

This gets into some more advanced selectors. Similar to the "and" selector, we can start getting into "child" selectors.

To select child elements, just put spaces between each selector.

Note that this selects **all** elements of the second selector inside elements of the first selector, no matter how far down nested they are!

Alternatively, you can select just the immediate child of a given selector by separating selectors with `>`

This is a little hard to demonstrate, so bear with me:

```html
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        .outer {
            background-color: orangered;
            height: 200px;
            width: 200px;
        }

        .middle {
            background-color: lawngreen;
            height: 150px;
            width: 150px;
        }

        .inner {
            background-color: cornflowerblue;
            height: 100px;
            width: 100px;
        }

        .first div {
            border-style: solid;
        }

        .second > div {
            border-style: solid;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <div class="first">
        <div class="outer">
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="inner">
                    content!
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="second">
        <div class="outer">
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="inner">
                    content!
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Selector Recap / Cheatsheet

```css
h1 {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-align: center;
}
```

Everything before the curly brackets `{}` is the **selector**, and everything inside the curly brackets `{}` is the declaration (or the styles that we want to apply)

-   `h1`
    -   selects all `h1` elements on the page
-   `h1, p`
    -   selects all `h1` and `p` elements on the page
-   `#some-id`
    -   selects all elements on the page that have the `id` attribute set to `some-id` (note that there should only be one element)
-   `.some-class`
    -   selects all elements on the page that have the `class` attribute set to `some-class`
-   `div p`
    -   selects all `p` elements that are inside `div` elements, no matter how far down they're nested
-   `div > p`
    -   selects all `p` elements that are directly inside `div` elements (alternatively, the "direct child" of `div` elements)

# When in doubt:

1.  Add a `div`
2.  Add a `class` to the `div`
3.  Style that class with CSS

And that will get you like 90% of the way there with all of your CSS problems!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A hypothetical situation

Let's say I have 10 pages on my site: `index.html`, `contact.html`, `about.html`, `portfolio.html`, `interests.html`, `etc.html`

Each page has the following **internal** styles that I've copied and pasted between them:

```html
<style>
    h1 {
        color: red;
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-align: center;
    }
</style>
```

All of a sudden, Marketing storms into your office and says "Epic Hacker Code Ninja Rockstar Web Developer Ken! We need your help!"

"We need to change all of the headings on our pages to blue!"

After briefly facepalming, you hop into your text editor, realize that you've now got to change the contents of the `<style>` tag in 10 different files. After another facepalm, you vow to find a better way to deal with this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# External Styles

If we have 10 different files that all use roughly the same styles, we should just keep all our styles in one place, not copy-pasted across 10 files.

Enter external styles, or **CSS files**!

We can define a CSS file by putting all of our CSS (the stuff inside the `<style>` tag) inside a file with the `.css` extension.

```css
/* style.css */
h1 {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-align: center;
}
```

Then, in our `index.html` we use a `<link>` tag with the `href` and the `rel` attributes to indicate that we want a "stylesheet" from the following URL:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Ken's Site</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

If we have multiple pages that use `style.css`, any changes that we make to `style.css` will apply to all of our pages. **Mathematical!**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "Best practice?"

You should **always** use external styles (CSS files).

You should **almost never** use inline styles (the `style` attribute) or internal styles (`<style>` tags)!

In the future, I'm going to exclusively use external stylesheets (CSS files) for all examples in class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Want to get into some complicated CSS?

-   Change the width of every `<p>` element to be 50% of the parent container's width
-   Apply a font to the entire page (also, check out <https://www.google.com/fonts>!)
-   Apply a background image to the page that doesn't move when the page scrolls (try `background-attachment`!)
-   Change the color/styling of links when they're `active`, `visited`, `hover`ed, or `focus`ed
-   Apply a 1px red border to **every element on the page**
-   Select all `h1`s that have a certain `id`
-   Select all `p`s that have a certain `class`
-   Select all `div`s that have both a `class` and an `id`
-   Select all `span`s that have both the classes `class1` and `class2`
-   Change the width of every `<p>` element to be 50% of the **page**'s width (check out `vw` units)

> _(I wish that a "parent" selector existed, but it doesn't. lots of "child" selectors, but no way to select the div that's the parent of all .something elements.)_

# Backgrounds!

`.kittens { background-image: url("kittens.jpg") }`

`.header-section { background-image: url("flatirons.jpg") }`

-   `background-image`
-   `background-position` ← where should the x/y coordinates of the image be on your element?
-   `background-size` ← how big is your background image? 100%? Cover? Fill?
-   `background` ← shorthand for all this stuff!

Other background styles:

-   `background-color`
-   `background-attachment`
-   `background-blend-mode`
-   `background-clip`
-   `background-origin`
-   `background-repeat`

# The CSS Box Model

Everything on the internet is basically just a series of nested boxes.

![The CSS Box Model](http://inserthtml.com/codex/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/box-model1.gif)

Every single element on the page has (from outside in) `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and content (or `height` and `width`)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Content

The dimensions of our element is based on the "content" of our element, which includes text and other nested elements.

If we've got a `<div>`, we can set the dimensions of our element by using the `height` and `width` style property.

Remember that the `height` and `width` properties only apply to the content - it doesn't include the `padding`, `border` or `margin`. **Mathematical!**

> _In session `5`, we'll talk more about the difference between `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block` elements. If you want to see the difference now, try messing around with the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`, and check out the `display` style property._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `padding`

Padding is the space between the content and the `border` of an element. You can use it to move text farther inside the element from the `border`! **Algebraic!**

`padding-top: 10px;`

> _Note: the space taken up by `padding` will still show any `background-color` or `background-image`._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `border`

Just what you think it is - the border surrounding an element. The content and `padding` space are both _inside_ the border. **Rhombus!**

```
border-style: dashed;
border-width: 10px;
border-color: purple;
```

> _(Advanced) Need to have the background show up underneath the `border`? Check out `background-clip`._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `margin`

The `margin` is the space of an element _outside_ the `border`. Think of it as some space that can be used to push elements apart.

We can use the `auto` keyword to automatically center an element inside of a block-level element, so long as we've already set the element's `width`. **Shmow-zow!**

```
margin-top: 10px;
margin-bottom: 10px;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
```

> _(We'll learn a bit more about centering and aligning things in session `5`.)_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Check those corners!

`border-radius` - actually applies to the radius of **corners**

`border-radius: 10px;` (shorthand to set all corners)

Can also do `border-bottom-left-radius`, `border-top-right-radius`, etc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Advanced: Shorthand properties

Shorthand properties let you set multiple styles at once.

Also, they do different things depending on how many arguments are supplied!

`background: <color> <img> <repeat> <position>`

`margin: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>` - (think clockwise)

`padding: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>` - (think clockwise)

`border: <br-width> <br-style> <color>`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
