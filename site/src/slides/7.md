`display` and `position` styles

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More Dumb Fun Web Stuff

<http://learnlayout.com/>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tonight: `display` and `position` styles

The **`display`** style has to do with how our element is **sized** on the page.

The **`position`** style has to do with **where** our element is placed on the page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `display` style

Every element on the page already has a `display` style declared on it!

The vast majority of them are `display: block`.

Some of them (like `<a>`, `<span>`, and `<img>` tags) are `display: inline`.

The `<head>` tag has `display: none`, which means that our `<meta>`, `<link>` and `<title>` tags don't get displayed.

To see this, bust open your dev tools, inspect the various elements, and check the "Computed" styles of the elements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: block`

By default, elements with `display: block` stretch all the way across to fill the parent container.

`div`s, headings, paragraphs, and most other elements have `display: block` by default!

Anchor tags and `span`s **don't** have `display: block` by default.

(If you really want, you can set them to be `display: block`, but I wouldn't recommend it.)

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    divs have display: block by default.
</div>
<div>
    notice how it stretches all the way across to fill the container?
</div>
<div class="fiftyPercent">
    <div>
        even if it's nested.
    </div>
</div>
<h1>headings have display: block by default,</h1>
<p>
    as well as paragraphs.
</p>
<a href="#">links and spans aren't display: block by default!</a>
<span>they don't stretch to fill the container automatically.</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div, h1, p, a, span {
    background-color: lightgray;
    margin: 10px;
}
.fiftyPercent {
    width: 50%;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: block` stacks vertically, regardless of element width

Even if I have a bunch of small elements with `display: block`, they'll stack in a column instead of a row.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    Even if my block-level elements are small
</div>
<div>
    And could easily stack in a row
</div>
<div>
    display: block will make them stack in a column
</div>
<div>
    regardless of width
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    background-color: lightgray;
    width: 25%;
    margin: 10px;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: inline`

What does an element with `display: inline` look like?

`display: inline` elements are commonly used inside other elements where it's important to not disrupt the flow of the content. They can also wrap over multiple lines!

`<a>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` and `<img>` tags are `display: inline` by default.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<p>
    Daftendirekt. Discovery doin' it right, oh yeah robot rock high life. Beyond burnin' get lucky. Discovery voyager voyager revolution 909. Funk. <a href="#">Inline elements are commonly found within other elements where it's important not to break the flow of the parent element.</a> Oh yeah, rollin' and scratchin' revolution 909 nightvision veridis quo. Within discovery. <span>They can also wrap over multiple lines!</span> Crescendolls fragments of time, technologic revolution 909 steam machine. Giorgio by moroder instant crush, touch touch. Veridis quo.
</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

a, span {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```

## Inline element stacking

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<span>If you have a bunch of inline elements, </span><span>they'll always stack in a row, </span><span>and can wrap down to the next line mid-element.</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

span {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```

## Inline element weirdness

Generally, **you cannot set the dimensions** of an element with `display: inline`.

However, even though `<img>` elements are **inline by default**, you can set the dimensions of those without issue.

Things get pretty weird when you try to throw `margin` or `padding` on an element with `display: inline`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: inline-block`

Elements with `display: inline-block` tend to combine the best of both worlds. Like a block element, they can be resized, and like an inline element, they normally stack in a row.

However, you might need to add `vertical-align: top` to ensure that they line up correctly. I just learned that today!

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    Like a block element (and unlike inline elements), inline-block elements can be resized
</div>
<div>
    And like inline elements (and unlike block elements), inline-block elements stack in rows!
</div>
<div>
    But, they must have display: inline-block set explicitly on them.
</div>
<div>
    They also wrap automatically!
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: top;
    /* hey, I learned something today! Apparently you need vertical-align: top to make sure that they all sit evenly in a row. Algebraic!! */
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: lightgray;
    margin: 10px;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: none`

`display: none` pretty much does exactly what you'd expect it to.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    This element isn't displayed on the page, but you can still see it in the page HTML! Check your dev tools.
</div>
<div>
    It's not invisible, and there's no space for it on the page - it's just not there!
</div>
<div>
    SpoooOooOooOOOooky!
</div>

<span>did somebody say something?</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    display: none;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: flex`

We already talked about flexbox a bit!

`display: flex` is a bit weird because it applies to the contents of the element, instead of how the element is sized.

In general, elements with `display: flex` can be sized and flow the same way as elements with `display: block`.

We'll cover flexbox in even more detail next session. In the meantime, if you want to learn more, check out the [CSS Tricks documentation](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) or play some [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `position` style

The `position` style tells the browser **where** to place our elements on the page. It's used for slightly different purposes than `display`.

By default, every element has `position: static`. It's not actually shown anywhere in dev tools by default `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `position: fixed`

The one that's going to make the most sense right away is `position: fixed`.

If you want a navbar that scrolls with the page, this is the way to do it!

However, don't forget to adjust the dimensions after you set `position: fixed`. `display: block` elements won't stretch all the way across the screen any more.

Don't forget to add some padding on the stuff underneath your fixed element, if you want it to look good in certain positions!

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this is my navbar! yay!
</div>

    background-color: lightgray
}

p {
    padding-top: 30px;
}
```

^ this might be a great situation to use `em` units?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` styles

The `top` style sets the **top edge** of your element to a certain distance from the top of the browser's viewport.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this element is 100px from the top of the browser viewport.
</div>

    top: 100px;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

You can do a similar thing with `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this element is 100px from a side of the browser viewport.

</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

.navbar {
    position: fixed;
    /* try uncommenting one of these at a time */
    /*top: 100px;*/
    right: 100px;
    /*bottom: 100px;*/
    /*left: 100px;*/
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Setting multiple `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` styles on an element

On positioned elements where you specify a `height`/`width`, `top` and `left` will override `bottom` and `right`.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    even though this element has top, right, bottom, and left set, only top and left are respected.
</div>

<p>

</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

.navbar {
    position: fixed;
    top: 100px;
    right: 100px;
    bottom: 100px;
    left: 100px;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

However, if you've got an element without any `height`/`width` styles, then setting `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` will **stretch** the element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this element has no height or width, so top, right, bottom, and left stretch the element to the appropriate dimensions.
</div>
