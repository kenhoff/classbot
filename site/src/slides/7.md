`display` and `position` styles

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# More Dumb Fun Web Stuff

<http://learnlayout.com/>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tonight: `display` and `position` styles

The **`display`** style has to do with how our element is **sized** on the page.

The **`position`** style has to do with **where** our element is placed on the page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `display` style

Every element on the page already has a `display` style declared on it!

The vast majority of them are `display: block`.

Some of them (like `<a>`, `<span>`, and `<img>` tags) are `display: inline`.

The `<head>` tag has `display: none`, which means that our `<meta>`, `<link>` and `<title>` tags don't get displayed.

To see this, bust open your dev tools, inspect the various elements, and check the "Computed" styles of the elements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: block`

By default, elements with `display: block` stretch all the way across to fill the parent container.

`div`s, headings, paragraphs, and most other elements have `display: block` by default!

Anchor tags and `span`s **don't** have `display: block` by default.

(If you really want, you can set them to be `display: block`, but I wouldn't recommend it.)

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    divs have display: block by default.
</div>
<div>
    notice how it stretches all the way across to fill the container?
</div>
<div class="fiftyPercent">
    <div>
        even if it's nested.
    </div>
</div>
<h1>headings have display: block by default,</h1>
<p>
    as well as paragraphs.
</p>
<a href="#">links and spans aren't display: block by default!</a>
<span>they don't stretch to fill the container automatically.</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div, h1, p, a, span {
    background-color: lightgray;
    margin: 10px;
}
.fiftyPercent {
    width: 50%;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: block` stacks vertically, regardless of element width

Even if I have a bunch of small elements with `display: block`, they'll stack in a column instead of a row.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    Even if my block-level elements are small
</div>
<div>
    And could easily stack in a row
</div>
<div>
    display: block will make them stack in a column
</div>
<div>
    regardless of width
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    background-color: lightgray;
    width: 25%;
    margin: 10px;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: inline`

What does an element with `display: inline` look like?

`display: inline` elements are commonly used inside other elements where it's important to not disrupt the flow of the content. They can also wrap over multiple lines!

`<a>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` and `<img>` tags are `display: inline` by default.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<p>
    Daftendirekt. Discovery doin' it right, oh yeah robot rock high life. Beyond burnin' get lucky. Discovery voyager voyager revolution 909. Funk. <a href="#">Inline elements are commonly found within other elements where it's important not to break the flow of the parent element.</a> Oh yeah, rollin' and scratchin' revolution 909 nightvision veridis quo. Within discovery. <span>They can also wrap over multiple lines!</span> Crescendolls fragments of time, technologic revolution 909 steam machine. Giorgio by moroder instant crush, touch touch. Veridis quo.
</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

a, span {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```

## Inline element stacking

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<span>If you have a bunch of inline elements, </span><span>they'll always stack in a row, </span><span>and can wrap down to the next line mid-element.</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

span {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```

## Inline element weirdness

Generally, **you cannot set the dimensions** of an element with `display: inline`.

However, even though `<img>` elements are **inline by default**, you can set the dimensions of those without issue.

Things get pretty weird when you try to throw `margin` or `padding` on an element with `display: inline`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: inline-block`

Elements with `display: inline-block` tend to combine the best of both worlds. Like a block element, they can be resized, and like an inline element, they normally stack in a row.

However, you might need to add `vertical-align: top` to ensure that they line up correctly. I just learned that today!

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    Like a block element (and unlike inline elements), inline-block elements can be resized
</div>
<div>
    And like inline elements (and unlike block elements), inline-block elements stack in rows!
</div>
<div>
    But, they must have display: inline-block set explicitly on them.
</div>
<div>
    They also wrap automatically!
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: top;
    /* hey, I learned something today! Apparently you need vertical-align: top to make sure that they all sit evenly in a row. Algebraic!! */
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: lightgray;
    margin: 10px;
}
```

<http://learnlayout.com/inline-block-layout.html>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: none`

`display: none` pretty much does exactly what you'd expect it to.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    This element isn't displayed on the page, but you can still see it in the page HTML! Check your dev tools.
</div>
<div>
    It's not invisible, and there's no space for it on the page - it's just not there!
</div>
<div>
    SpoooOooOooOOOooky!
</div>

<span>did somebody say something?</span>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    display: none;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `display: flex`

We already talked about flexbox a bit!

`display: flex` is a bit weird because it applies to the contents of the element, instead of how the element is sized.

In general, elements with `display: flex` can be sized and flow the same way as elements with `display: block`.

We'll cover flexbox in even more detail next session. In the meantime, if you want to learn more, check out the [CSS Tricks documentation](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) or play some [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `position` style

The `position` style tells the browser **where** to place our elements on the page. It's used for slightly different purposes than `display`.

By default, every element has `position: static`. It's not actually shown anywhere in dev tools by default `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `position: fixed`

The one that's going to make the most sense right away is `position: fixed`.

If you want a navbar that scrolls with the page, this is the way to do it!

However, don't forget to adjust the dimensions after you set `position: fixed`. `display: block` elements won't stretch all the way across the screen any more.

Don't forget to add some padding on the stuff underneath your fixed element, if you want it to look good in certain positions!

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this is my navbar! yay!

    background-color: lightgray
}

p {
    padding-top: 30px;
}
```

^ this might be a great situation to use `em` units?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` styles

The `top` style sets the **top edge** of your element to a certain distance from the top of the browser's viewport.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this element is 100px from the top of the browser viewport.
</div>

    top: 100px;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

You can do a similar thing with `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this element is 100px from a side of the browser viewport.

}
```

# Setting multiple `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` styles on an element

On positioned elements where you specify a `height`/`width`, `top` and `left` will override `bottom` and `right`.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    even though this element has top, right, bottom, and left set, only top and left are respected.
</div>

<p>

</p>
```

```css
/* style.css */

.navbar {
    position: fixed;
    top: 100px;
    right: 100px;
    bottom: 100px;
    left: 100px;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

However, if you've got an element without any `height`/`width` styles, then setting `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` will **stretch** the element.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="navbar">
    this element has no height or width, so top, right, bottom, and left stretch the element to the appropriate dimensions.
</div>

```css

    top: 100px;
    right: 100px;
    bottom: 100px;
    left: 100px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `position: relative`

`position: relative` basically "shifts" an element by a certain amount.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    this is a normal, statically positioned element.
</div>
<div class="relativeDiv">
    this div is positioned 20px down and 20px to the right
</div>
<div>
    this is a normal, statically positioned element.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin: 10px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
    border: 1px solid black;
}

.relativeDiv {
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px;
}
```

Notice that setting `top` and `left` shifts the `div` down and right. Remember, you're setting the top edge of the element to a certain distance inside the normal position!

You can also use negative values to "reverse shift" elements!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# `position: absolute`

`position: absolute` elements are positioned sort of like `position: fixed` elements, but the element doesn't stay affixed to the browser viewport.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    this element is absolutely positioned 20px from the bottom right of the page.
</div>

    right: 20px;
    height: 150px;
    width: 150px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
}
```

**This might not be the behavior that you want.** Ideally, I might want that element to be 20px from the bottom right of the **content** of the page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "positioned" elements

There's this wonderful (read: complicated) concept known as "positioned" elements.

In essence, a "positioned" element has a `position` of `fixed`, `relative`, or `absolute`. (Not `static`, which is what all elements are by default.)

`position: absolute` behaves in kind of a funky way - it will find the **nearest positioned ancestor** (looks at the parent to see if it's `fixed`/`relative`/`absolute`, if not, looks at that element's parent to see if it's `fixed`/`relative`/`absolute`, etc) and set its own position relative to that.

If it can't find one, it'll just set relative to the viewport, just like `position: fixed`.

Easy fix? Yeah. If you want to set its position absolutely _within_ an element, just make the parent element `position: relative` and don't change anything else on it.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div>
    this element is absolutely positioned 20px from the bottom right of the the parent element.
</div>

# differences between `position: relative` and `position: absolute`

There's one fundamental difference between `relative` and `absolute`.

When you set an element with `position: absolute`, there's no whitespace for the element. It's as if the element doesn't exist within the normal, main flow of the page.

When you set an element with `position: relative`, there's still whitespace for the element. If you don't set any positioning styles, the element will still be in the same place as normal, and other content will flow with it normally. If you move the element around a lot, then there will still be whitespace where the element used to be.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="one">
    this is the first element. it doesn't have any position styles.
</div>
<div class="two">
    this is the second element. it's absolutely positioned, so there's no whitespace for it in the layout of the page.
</div>
<div class="three">
    this is the third element. it's relatively positioned, but doesn't have any positioning styles (top, right, bottom, left) on it, so it doesn't appear to be out of place.
</div>
<div class="four">
    this is the fourth element. it's relatively positioned way out of place, but the whitespace still appears for it in the main flow of the page.
</div>
<div class="five">
    this is the fifth element. its name is leeloo. it's relatively positioned slightly out of place, and the whitespace for it still appears behind it.
</div>
<div class="six">
    this is the first element. it doesn't have any position styles.
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

div {
    height: 150px;
    width: 150px;
    margin: 10px;
    background-color: chartreuse;
    border: 1px solid black;
}
.two {
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;
    right: 10px;
}
.three, .four, .five {
    position: relative;
}

.four {
    top: 500px;
    left: 500px;
}

.five {
    top: 10px;
    left: 10px;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The `z-index` style

Finally! Almost done!

If you've got some overlapping positioned elements, consider using `z-index` to determine which elements are on top of the page.

**Elements with higher `z-index` values will go on top of elements with lower `z-index` values.**

Try messing around with some of the `z-index` values in this example:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<div class="bottom one">
    bottom
</div>
<div class="middle two">
    middle
</div>
<div class="top three">
    top
</div>
```

```css
/* style.css */

# Go forth and conquer!

Work on your portfolio page, or your client project!

Add a navbar that sticks to the top of the page when you scroll!

Maybe a photo collage, with a couple of the images overlapping each other?

Whatever you want!
