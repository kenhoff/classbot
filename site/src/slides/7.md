Bootstrap themes!

Bootstrap theme sites
Generally, there’s 4 sites that I turn to for themes:
https://bootswatch.com/
Literally just reskins of Bootstrap
http://startbootstrap.com/
Classy, free portfolio-ish sites. 1 or 2 app admin sites.
http://www.bootstrapzero.com/
Compilation from a bunch of free themes around the web - ymmv.
https://wrapbootstrap.com/
Paid themes - some powerful, some...meh. Careful about the code quality on a lot of these.
There’s probably lots more places to get themes out there!





Let’s build! - Bootswatch
https://bootswatch.com/
Literally just reskins of original Bootstrap

If you’ve built a site with Bootstrap, you can just include a Bootswatch theme instead of the builtin Bootstrap theme, and everything will still work fine, just with a different theme

Can also use the Bootswatch CDN: https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/

Let’s build! - StartBootstrap
http://startbootstrap.com/
Not quite reskins of original bootstrap, but still reuses a lot of the components
Most of these are one page sites


The best way to learn these? Experiment



Tons more bootstrap resources

That’s it!

Case study: Bootstrap on the web
https://expo.getbootstrap.com/

Getting set up with Bootstrap again
http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>



Standard components vs Javascript components
Standard components: http://getbootstrap.com/components/
Generally don’t include interaction - dropdowns are the exception, and require jQuery and bootstrap.js (see below)

Javascript components: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/
Generally include some type of interaction (dropdowns, modals, tooltips, etc)
Requires jQuery and bootstrap.js!
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>



Some standard components

Jumbotron!
We’ve used this one before!
http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron


Navs & Navbars
http://getbootstrap.com/components/#nav
Can use pills or tabs - good for small amounts of navigation, or if you need nested navigation

http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar
Navbars span the entire width, but can be affixed to the top or bottom
Dropdowns, form elements
Builtin responsive support - collapses on narrow screens



Glyphicons
http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons

Need something like ✭ ?

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star" />

Control size with font-size: 10px

Some Javascript components
Don’t forget about jQuery and bootstrap.js!
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>



Modals
http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals

Modals are those little popup window thingies - sometimes called lightboxes

Use the examples!

Modals work with the data-target, data-toggle, and data-dismiss attributes

Carousels
http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel

Auto-progressing image rotator thingies - easy way to show multiple images without any scrolling.



Case study in responsiveness
Responsiveness - how a page changes on different devices (usually just different page widths)

(also, every single article from Boz is great)

Bootstrap time!

Cool things we can do with Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a framework that gives us a couple things:
A responsive grid system
A default theme with CSS
Some Javascript-enabled, interactable components


http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples



Installing Bootstrap
http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>


Bootstrap CSS
By default, Bootstrap gives us a bunch of styling for elements


Let’s experiment!


Everything is on http://getbootstrap.com/css/



Bootstrap Grid System
Might be easier than flexbox!

Everything should go in a .container or .container-fluid ← remember, if it starts with a “.” it’s a class
A container has a series of .rows
Each .row has a series of .col-md-1s (or similar - needs a size and width)

.rows and .cols can be nested - .cols inside of .rows inside of .cols inside of .rows...




Bootstrap Grid System
Each .row has 12 columns total (regardless of screen size or nesting!)

You can specify col width size with class name:
.col-xs-12 ← 12-column-wide column on extra-small devices and up
.col-sm-6 ← 6-column-wide column on small devices and up
.col-md-4 ← 4-column-wide column on medium devices and up
.col-lg-1 ← 1-column-wide column on large devices and up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Centering

Screw it - just use flexbox.

The absolute best guide to flexbox: <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/>

tons of flexbox options.

Note - IE 9 and earlier doesn't support flexbox.

Web developers love having to support old IE versions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(scrubs IE image)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Centering

`.container { display: flex; }`

`.elementInContainer { margin: auto; }`

don't forget to give the container a height if you want it vertically centered!

If nothing else works: <http://howtocenterincss.com/>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CSS Box Model

Every element is a rectangular box.

Each box has width, height, and a top/bottom/left/right border, margin, and padding

More info: <https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/>

Almost every site on the internet is built out of nested boxes (usually `<div>`s)

The CSS Box Model.

Lay out the content on your page using nested boxes!

To adjust your boxes:

width

height

padding (padding-top/bottom/left/right)

border-style, border-width, border-radius, border-color

margin (margin-top/bottom/left/right)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# block vs inline vs inline-block

display: block takes up the entire width of an element, and can't be placed side-by-side to other elements. Its height and width can be changed!

display: inline only takes up as much space as its content does, and is placed side-by-side to other elements. Its height and width cannot be changed!

display: inline-block only takes up as much space as its content does, and is placed side-by-side to other elements. Its height and width can be changed!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That’s it!






That’s it!
