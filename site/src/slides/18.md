On August 23rd at 9pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!

Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects:

-   Portfolio (assignment 4)
-   Client Project (assignment 9)
-   Coin Flipping App (assignment 14)
-   Social Network Front End (assignment 19)

Remember to check your grades with `grades` on @classbot!

Remember to create separate site44 apps for your projects so that potential clients and employers can see them!

# The Social Network Front End Project

For your final project, I'm going to have you create the **front end** to the Spark Front End Web Development Social Network.

All of the students in the class are on the Social Network! You can create new posts, and everyone else in the Social Network can see those posts.

For your front end,  you'll need at least 2 pages:

-   a **main page** which shows all the posts in the Social Network
    -   The main page (probably your `index.html`) should show all the posts in the Social Network, from most recent to least recent. Each post has some content, an author, and a date/time that it was created.
-   a **secret posting page** that lets you post to the Social Network
    -   Your posting page should have a text box where you can punch in some content, and then a button that lets you create a post on the Social Network. **Your posting page should be secret! Only you should know the URL for it, otherwise other people will be able to post to your profile.**

You'll need to make requests to the API to create and get posts on the Social Network. All of the API documentation is up at <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/>.

Some notes:

-   Your `profile_id` is just your Slack username.
-   You'll need a `profile_secret` in order to post to the Social Network. I'll direct message you your `profile_secret` in Slack.
-   Don't share your `profile_secret` with anyone, and don't share the URL of your posting page with anyone, or else they'll be able to post to your profile as you!
-   Don't put your `profile_secret` anywhere in your `index.html`, and don't include it in any scripts that are included in your `index.html` - otherwise, I'll be able to open that script and find it.
-   Use common sense when creating a post on the Social Network. I'm not moderating it at all, but keep it PG-13 please.
-   Use common sense when using the Social Network API. It can pretty easily handle 1000s of posts, but it doesn't have any restrictions on the amount of posts that you can create, or how often you create posts. If you write a `for` loop that does nothing but create spam posts all day, then I'm going to be sad :(

Logistics:

-   Remember to create a separate site44 site, and keep it up after the class ends so that potential clients and employers can see it!
-   Submit your site44 site for [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   This info is available on [readings 19](/readings/19) and [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   Ask for help! I just wrote this thing, so if something's not so clear, I can definitely improve it. Let me know!

# More dumb fun web stuff

Really, really cool one today!

<http://xkcd.com/1663>

When you load the page, you get a fragment appended to the URL (a fragment is the # bit). This creates a new game, and sends some information off to the server, including unique info about your browser, so you can share a read-only URL with others. Every time you edit the page, it sends your edits to the server, and the server runs your garden continuously.

<http://xkcd.com/1663/#55944f62-fa9b-11e5-8001-42010a8e0010>

When you load a URL that already has a fragment, it loads up that specific game, and the controls if you’re accessing it from the original browser.

# Node.js

You know how we can run JavaScript in the browser?

We can also run JavaScript in **Node.js**!

Things look a little different between the two:

-   In the browser, you get some builtin variables/objects, like `document` and `window`
-   In Node, you get a whole different bunch of builtin variables/objects, like `fs` and `require`

> _Node.js is built on top of the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/)! V8 takes JavaScript code and turns it into machine code (pure hexadecimal code, instructions for the CPU to execute)_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Downloading Node.js

In order to follow along today, you'll have to download and install Node.js.

<https://nodejs.org/en/>

6.9.1 should be totally fine!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Running JavaScript with Node.js

**Create a new directory** (it doesn't have to be in your site44 site, but it can be if you want) with a file `index.js` in it, and put the following in `index.js`:

```javascript
// index.js

console.log("Hello, this is running from Node.js!");
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Running your Node.js script - but first, a Command Line Crash Course

If you're a Mac user, go ahead an open up the Terminal app (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).

If you're a Windows user, I'd recommend [downloading Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and running that. If you're feeling particularly ambitious (outside of this session), you can try enabling [the Windows 10 bash shell thingy](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/).

Once you've got Terminal/Git Bash open, try typing `cd`, `ls`, or `pwd`, followed by an enter.

-   `cd` changes your current directory
-   `ls` lists everything in your current directory
-   `pwd` prints the full path of your current directory
-   hitting the tab key while typing out a file or directory name will auto-complete the name (very handy for directory names with spaces in them!)
-   `cd ..` will move your current directory one "level" up

Remember: a "file system" is just a big tree of nested folders. There's only one folder all the way up at the top, at the "root" of your file system (the `/` path), and your site44 apps are probably way down in `/Users/ken/Dropbox/Apps/site44/notajetski.site44.com` or something.

## Your challenge:

Using the command line (your Terminal/Git Bash), navigate into the directory that contains your `index.js`.

Once you're in the correct directory (if you type `ls` and hit enter, you should see `index.js`), type in `node index.js` and hit enter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Listening for HTTP requests with Express

To listen for incoming HTTP requests, we’ll use a library called [Express](http://expressjs.com/). It turns our little Node script into a web server!

## Install Express

Before we can use Express in our project, we need to set up our Node "app" and install Express next to our app. No CDN's here, sorry!

On the command line, inside the directory that contains your `index.js`, run the following commands:

-   `npm init` (then just hit enter a bunch - all of the defaults in this case should be fine)
-   `npm install express --save`

> _Note: while it will work without it, `--save` is required for deploying to Modulus (more on that later)_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Initializing Express and telling it to be a web server

Inside of your `index.js`:

```javascript
// index.js

var express = require("express");
var app = express();
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 1234);
```

This tells express to start "listening" on port 1234 (or, whatever port Modulus assigns. More on Modulus later)

Run the script again with `node index.js` - what happens on the command line?

To "kill" your server and go back to the command line, press `ctrl-C`. (It's `ctrl-C`, not `⌘-C` !)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Receiving HTTP requests

Now, let's tell the server to respond when someone tries to get the root path, or `/`:

```javascript
// index.js

var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get("/", function(request, response) {
	console.log("hey! something happened!");
})

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 1234);
```

Restart your server by killing (`ctrl-C`) and rerunning (`node index.js`) your script.

Then, open a browser and go to <http://localhost:1234/>. What happens in the browser? What happens on your command line?

> _Why do we need to kill and restart the server every time we change the code?_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sending data back in response

Now, let's tell the server to send something back in response every time someone tries to get the root path (`/`):

```javascript
// index.js

var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get("/", function(request, response) {
	console.log("hey! something happened!");
	response.send("client says what?");
})

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 1234);
```

Restart your server again, then try to go to <http://localhost:1234/>. What do you see?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting info from the URL

Let's make it a little more complicated by getting some info from the URL:

```javascript
// index.js

var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get("/", function(request, response) {
	console.log("hey! something happened!");
	response.send("client says what?");
})

app.get("/hello/:name", function(request, response) {
	response.send("Hello, " + request.params.name + "!")
})

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 1234);
```

Restart, and go to <http://localhost:1234/hello/yourname>. What happens?

# A whole new hosting platform: Gomix

We’re going to use [Gomix](https://gomix.com/) to host our Node.js code. It’s a _little_ like site44, but runs full-stack Node.js apps instead!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting Started with Gomix

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Submitting Gomix apps as assignments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Debugging Gomix

# A whole new hosting platform: Modulus

We’re going to use [Modulus](https://modulus.io/) to host our Node.js code. It’s a little like site44, but runs Node.js apps instead!

Normally it’s not free, but they give you a $15 credit when you sign up, and they don’t require payment info. That should be enough to host a tiny server full-time for 2 months - more than enough for what we’re doing in the class!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Getting Started with Modulus

## Install the Modulus command line tools:

On the command line, run:

`npm install modulus -g`

If you get an error with that, try:

`sudo npm install modulus -g`

(you'll have to type in your password)

## Sign up for Modulus

On the command line, run:

`modulus signup`

> _(pretty cool that you can sign up from the command line, right?)_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a new Modulus project

On the command line, navigate to your project folder, then run:

`modulus project create`

Name it whatever you like!

When asked for the runtime, select `Node.js`.

When asked for the servo size, enter `192`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Deploy your Node.js app to Modulus

On the command line, in your project folder, run:

`modulus deploy`

Confirm that you’re deploying the right app, and hit `enter`!

(sit and wait for a minute or two)

Then, navigate to your app in the browser (something like <http://yourappnamehere-12345.onmodulus.net>) and check that everything is working as expected.

Marvel at your unlimited cosmic power!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Debugging Modulus

If your Modulus stuff isn’t working, try running `modulus logs`. It might give you a clue as to what’s broken!

-   Are you in the right directory?
-   Did you run `npm init` and `npm install express --save` in the right directory?
-   Did you run `modulus deploy` from the right directory?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# That's all I've got for today!

What questions are there?
