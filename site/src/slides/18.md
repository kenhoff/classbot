More dumb fun web stuff
The best parallax visualization I‚Äôve ever seen:

If you want to use parallax, use skrollr (https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr)

Don‚Äôt use skrollr - complete nightmare to get set up. More later in the slides.


Notes on the end of class
On April 27th at 8pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get sent to Arieann, for internship placement services.
Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects (Client, Lorem Ipsum, and Portfolio)
Remember to check your grades with grades!
Remember to create separate firebase apps for your projects (and that they‚Äôre submitted to the grader for the right assignments), so that potential employers can see them!

Internships?
You don‚Äôt have to do this right now, but if you‚Äôre interested, be sure to do it before April 27th at 8pm.

If you‚Äôre interested in Spark‚Äôs help with finding an internship, fill out this form, and select the ‚Äúseeking an internship‚Äù option! Fill out all the other stuff too.

For each student, I usually send a short recommendation to Arieann (along with report cards). If you‚Äôre selected for internship placement services, she‚Äôll get in touch with you via email.


Get a job!
Usually get 5-10 leads a week through the CU CS jobs list!

Google tour details
The guy hasn‚Äôt gotten back to me yet - not sure if it‚Äôs going to happen :(

(tentative morning of April 25th?)



Tonight
on Front End Web Development:


Portfolios, part 2!

What to submit
Assignments 17 & 18: Submit a couple versions of your portfolio page.
Assignment 19: Submit the final version of your portfolio page.

Create a separate Firebase app to host your portfolio page, and keep it live after the class ends! We want to make sure that potential employers can see it.

The URL that you submit for assignment 19 gets sent along with your report card.

How are portfolio sites going?
Anyone want to show off progress so far?

Parallax time!
Parallax is hard. (much harder than I thought!)

Your two best options are using pure CSS or Stellar.js.

Another option is ScrollMagic or skrollr, but they‚Äôre pretty complicated.

Parallax: the pure CSS option
Go through this entire article, word-for-word:
http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/
Advantages:
No javascript!
Literally setting the 3d position of elements
Disadvantages:
Can‚Äôt have overlapping divs - have to position everything very carefully
Mobile support doesn‚Äôt respect scroll momentum

Parallax: the Stellar.js option
Check the docs: http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/docs/
It‚Äôs a jQuery plugin!
Advantages:
Works with mobile pretty well!
Simple setup
Disadvantages:
Images and ‚Äúviewports‚Äù have to be big enough
I was having some issues with horizontal offsets and mobile - little bit weird.


Let‚Äôs make some Parallaxed Pugs!
Pugs: https://trello.com/c/nEkA70xI/74-lecture-lab-porfolio-part-2


Parallaxed Pugs setup
Create an index.html
Go ahead and add 	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">, or otherwise you might end up with some Giant Pugs later



Parallaxed Pugs: The Puggening
.pug {
	background-position: center center;
	background-size: cover;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-attachment: fixed;
	height: 100vh; ‚Üê viewport height
	max-width: 100%;
}
.pug1 {
	background-image: url("/img/pug1.jpeg");
}

<h1>pugs pugs pugs pugs pugs</h1>
<div class="pug pug1"></div>
<h1 class="">oh my god look at all these pugs</h1>
<div class="pug pug2"></div>




Yay for pugs!
If you don‚Äôt care about the images actually moving, you‚Äôre all done! Hooray!

If you need the images to move, let‚Äôs use Stellar.js.

First, go out and download this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js/master/jquery.stellar.min.js

Save it, and put it in your project folder

Pugpocalypse - including some scripts
In <head>:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="/jquery.stellar.min.js"></script>
At the bottom of <body>:
<script>
	$.stellar({
		horizontalScrolling: false,
		responsive: true
	}); </script>


The Final Step
<div class="pug pug1" data-stellar-background-ratio="0.5"></div>
