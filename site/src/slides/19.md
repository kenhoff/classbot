# THE END IS NIGH

It's the end of the class! Freak out!

On August 24th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!

Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects:

-   Portfolio (assignment 4)
-   Client Project (assignment 9)
-   TSA Randomizer (assignment 14)
-   Random Quote App (assignment 19)

Remember to check your grades with `grades` on @classbot!

Remember to create separate Firebase apps (or site44 apps) for your projects so that potential clients employers can see them!

# Internships + end-of-class survey

<https://goo.gl/forms/0Nvw57KlcOCYSSLW2>

You donâ€™t have to do this right now, but if youâ€™re interested, be sure to do it before August 24th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends).

If you're interested in getting an internship with Spark's help, select the "I'm seeking an internship in a related field" option at the bottom of the survey. It'll ask you some more questions about what kind of internship you're interested in.

## The CU CS Jobs list

Sign up for the CU CS jobs mailing list! I usually get 5-10 leads a week through there.

# Google Tour details

There are multiple Google buildings in Boulder!

Weâ€™re meeting in the lobby of the one on the SW corner of 26th and Pearl. (Google Bldg 2590)

Parking is available all around that building (2590), and any parking designated for Google is available for guests.

Weâ€™re meeting in that lobby at 11am on Monday, August 22nd. Please be on time!

If you need a ride, please let us know! Coordinate in #general on Slack. Iâ€™m available to give rides, and other students may be too.

# It's the last session WOOHOO

Who wants to show off a Random Quote App?

Who wants to show off literally anything at all?

Any last things that you want to learn?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What happens after the class ends?

The Slack is going to still be around, and Iâ€™ll still be responsive on it!

Iâ€™ll add everyone to the #alumni channel on Slack so that we still have a place to hang.

The Fall class will start in October-ish, so you may want to leave the #general channel so you donâ€™t get excess notifications.

## What happens to @classbot after class ends?

@classbot will still be around! For a little while, anyway.

I'm most likely going to be switching up the grading/syllabus systems for the Fall class. Not sure what it's going to look like just yet!

# Future freelance/consulting/contract work

If you do freelance work for a client youâ€™ve never worked with before OR for a nontrivial amount of compensation (>$500), Iâ€™d recommend signing a contract before beginning any real work.

Hofftech Standard Contract (Iâ€™m updating this all the time): <https://github.com/hofftech/hofftech_docs/blob/master/contract.md>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Obligatory Hofftech Pitch

If you ever need help with anything, let me know! Totally down to have a look at your code. (you obviously donâ€™t need to pay me)

If you find someone that needs a web app built, let me know! Iâ€™d be happy to hire you on as a subcontractor so you can make some money and get some more experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The End

Itâ€™s been awesome having you guys! Stay in touch!

You can always, always reach me at <mailto:ken@hoff.tech> (or on Slack) for anything at all! Help with web dev stuff, job searching, news about your life, getting a beer to catch up, whatever! I love hearing about student life post-class.

Iâ€™ll miss you all :'(
