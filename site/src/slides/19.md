On December 14th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!

Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects:

-   Portfolio (assignment 4)
-   Client Project (assignment 9)
-   Coin Flipping App (assignment 14)
-   Social Network Front End (assignment 19)

Remember to check your grades with `grades` on @classbot!

Remember to create separate site44 apps for your projects so that potential clients and employers can see them!

# The Social Network Front End Project

For your final project, I'm going to have you create the **front end** to the Spark Front End Web Development Social Network.

All of the students in the class are on the Social Network! You can create new posts, and everyone else in the Social Network can see those posts.

For your front end,  you'll need at least 2 pages:

-   a **main page** which shows all the posts in the Social Network
    -   The main page (probably your `index.html`) should show all the posts in the Social Network, from most recent to least recent. Each post has some content, an author, and a date/time that it was created.
-   a **secret posting page** that lets you post to the Social Network
    -   Your posting page should have a text box where you can punch in some content, and then a button that lets you create a post on the Social Network. **Your posting page should be secret! Only you should know the URL for it, otherwise other people will be able to post to your profile.**

You'll need to make requests to the API to create and get posts on the Social Network. All of the API documentation is up at <https://spark-class-social-network-api.hoff.tech/>.

Some notes:

-   Your `profile_id` is just your Slack username.
-   You'll need a `profile_secret` in order to post to the Social Network. I'll direct message you your `profile_secret` in Slack.
-   Don't share your `profile_secret` with anyone, and don't share the URL of your posting page with anyone, or else they'll be able to post to your profile as you!
-   Don't put your `profile_secret` anywhere in your `index.html`, and don't include it in any scripts that are included in your `index.html` - otherwise, I'll be able to open that script and find it.
-   Use common sense when creating a post on the Social Network. I'm not moderating it at all, but keep it PG-13 please.
-   Use common sense when using the Social Network API. It can pretty easily handle 1000s of posts, but it doesn't have any restrictions on the amount of posts that you can create, or how often you create posts. If you write a `for` loop that does nothing but create spam posts all day, then I'm going to be sad :(

Logistics:

-   Remember to create a separate site44 site, and keep it up after the class ends so that potential clients and employers can see it!
-   Submit your site44 site for [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   This info is available on [readings 19](/readings/19) and [assignment 19](/assignments/19).
-   Ask for help! I just wrote this thing, so if something's not so clear, I can definitely improve it. Let me know!

# It's the last session WOOHOO

Who wants to show off a Spark Front End Web Development Social Network Front End?

Who wants to show off literally anything at all?

Any last things that you want to learn?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What happens after the class ends?

The Slack is going to still be around, and Iâ€™ll still be responsive on it!

Iâ€™ll add everyone to the #alumni channel on Slack so that we still have a place to hang.

The Spring class will start in February-ish, so you may want to leave the #general channel so you donâ€™t get excess notifications.

## What happens to @classbot after class ends?

@classbot will still be around for the next week or so!

I turn off @classbot when the class isn't in session, to save on hosting. But once the class picks up in the Spring, it'll be online for you to use again!

# Future freelance/consulting/contract work

If you do freelance work for a client youâ€™ve never worked with before OR for a nontrivial amount of compensation (>$500), Iâ€™d recommend signing a contract before beginning any real work.

You can use the [Hofftech Standard Contract](https://github.com/hofftech/hofftech_docs/blob/master/contract.md), but it's possible that I'll move my contracts and billing stuff over to [Bonsai](https://www.hellobonsai.com/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Obligatory Hofftech Pitch

If you ever need help with anything, say hi! Totally down to grab coffee and look at your code. (you obviously donâ€™t need to pay me)

If you or someone you know is working on a charity, 501c3, or social impact project, let me know. I can usually spend an evening or two on the project in exchange for pizza and beer `:D`

And if you find someone that needs an app (or anything else) built, definitely get in touch! Iâ€™d be happy to hire you on as a subcontractor so you can make some money and get some more experience.

You can always, always reach me at <mailto:ken@hoff.tech> (or on Slack) for anything at all! Help with web dev stuff, job searching, news about your life, getting a beer to catch up, whatever! I love hearing about student life post-class.

Iâ€™ll miss you all :'(

# Parallaxed Pugs: The Puggening!

Here's a dumb fun web dev project!

First, go download a crapton of pugs and put them in your project folder: <https://unsplash.com/search/pug>

Then, create your `index.html`:

```html
<html>

<head>
	<style>
		.pug {
			background-position: center center;
			background-size: cover;
			background-repeat: no-repeat;
			background-attachment: fixed;
			height: 100vh;
			max-width: 100%;
		}

		.pug1 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug1.jpeg");
		}

		.pug2 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug2.jpeg");
		}

		.pug3 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug3.jpeg");
		}

		.pug4 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug4.jpeg");
		}

		.pug5 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug5.jpeg");
		}

		.pug6 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug6.jpeg");
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>oh my god look at all these pugs</h1>
	<div class="pug pug1"></div>
	<h1>i just love all their little squished faces</h1>
	<div class="pug pug2"></div>
