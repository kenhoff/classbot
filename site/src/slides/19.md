# THE END IS NIGH

It's the end of the class! Freak out!

On August 24th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends), report cards get generated!

Report cards include grades on all assignments, attendance, and links to projects:

-   Portfolio (assignment 4)
-   Client Project (assignment 9)
-   TSA Randomizer (assignment 14)
-   Random Quote App (assignment 19)

Remember to check your grades with `grades` on @classbot!

Remember to create separate Firebase apps (or site44 apps) for your projects so that potential clients employers can see them!

# Internships + end-of-class survey

<https://goo.gl/forms/0Nvw57KlcOCYSSLW2>

You donâ€™t have to do this right now, but if youâ€™re interested, be sure to do it before August 24th at 9pm (1 week after the class ends).

If you're interested in getting an internship with Spark's help, select the "I'm seeking an internship in a related field" option at the bottom of the survey. It'll ask you some more questions about what kind of internship you're interested in.

## The CU CS Jobs list

Sign up for the CU CS jobs mailing list! I usually get 5-10 leads a week through there.

# Google Tour

It's on! We're touring Google Boulder at 10am on Friday, August 19th.

**If you're planning on coming, you needed to confirm with me on Slack by 8am, Tuesday, August 16th.** If you didn't confirm with me, you won't be able to go on the tour. Google's pretty strict on names and lists and stuff.

## Tour day

**Weâ€™re meeting in the lobby of Google BLD 2590 at 10am on Friday, August 19th. Please be on time!**

There are multiple Google buildings in Boulder!

Weâ€™re meeting in the lobby of the one on the SW corner of 26th and Pearl. (Google Bldg 2590)

Parking is available all around that building (2590), and any parking designated for Google is available for guests. However, if you can't find any parking, I usually park in the lots on the SE corner of 26th and Pearl - sort of between Hazel's and the Pho place.

If you need a ride, please let us know! Coordinate in #general on Slack. Iâ€™m available to give rides, and other students may be too.

# It's the last session WOOHOO

Who wants to show off a Random Quote App?

Who wants to show off literally anything at all?

Any last things that you want to learn?

# Parallaxed Pugs: The Puggening!

Here's a dumb fun web dev project!

First, go download a crapton of pugs and put them in your project folder: <https://unsplash.com/search/pug>

Then, create your `index.html`:

```html
<html>

<head>
	<style>
		.pug {
			background-position: center center;
			background-size: cover;
			background-repeat: no-repeat;
			background-attachment: fixed;
			height: 100vh;
			max-width: 100%;
		}

		.pug1 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug1.jpeg");
		}

		.pug2 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug2.jpeg");
		}

		.pug3 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug3.jpeg");
		}

		.pug4 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug4.jpeg");
		}

		.pug5 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug5.jpeg");
		}

		.pug6 {
			background-image: url("pugs/pug6.jpeg");
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>oh my god look at all these pugs</h1>
	<div class="pug pug1"></div>
	<h1>i just love all their little squished faces</h1>
	<div class="pug pug2"></div>
	<h1>isn't pug such a funny word</h1>
	<div class="pug pug3"></div>
	<h1>i love pugs</h1>
	<div class="pug pug4"></div>
	<h1>pugs pugs pugs pugs pugs</h1>
	<div class="pug pug5"></div>
	<h1>it took me way too long to make this</h1>
	<div class="pug pug6"></div>
	<h1>YAY FOR PUGS</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

# YAY FOR PUGS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What happens after the class ends?

The Slack is going to still be around, and Iâ€™ll still be responsive on it!

Iâ€™ll add everyone to the #alumni channel on Slack so that we still have a place to hang.

The Fall class will start in October-ish, so you may want to leave the #general channel so you donâ€™t get excess notifications.

## What happens to @classbot after class ends?

@classbot will still be around! For a little while, anyway.

I'm most likely going to be switching up the grading/syllabus systems for the Fall class. Not sure what it's going to look like just yet!

# Future freelance/consulting/contract work

If you do freelance work for a client youâ€™ve never worked with before OR for a nontrivial amount of compensation (>$500), Iâ€™d recommend signing a contract before beginning any real work.

Hofftech Standard Contract (Iâ€™m updating this all the time): <https://github.com/hofftech/hofftech_docs/blob/master/contract.md>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Obligatory Hofftech Pitch

If you ever need help with anything, let me know! Totally down to have a look at your code. (you obviously donâ€™t need to pay me)

If you find someone that needs a web app built, let me know! Iâ€™d be happy to hire you on as a subcontractor so you can make some money and get some more experience.

# When you realize that web development is your life, forever

# The End

Itâ€™s been awesome having you guys! Stay in touch!

You can always, always reach me at <mailto:ken@hoff.tech> (or on Slack) for anything at all! Help with web dev stuff, job searching, news about your life, getting a beer to catch up, whatever! I love hearing about student life post-class.

Iâ€™ll miss you all :'(
