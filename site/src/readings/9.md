## Client Project Show-and-Tell, Lab session

Hey folks - for your client project, you can basically have any client you want, besides yourself!

If you already have an idea of who you'd like to work with, great!

**If you're not sure who you'd like to work with yet, I'd recommend reaching out to @dannywalsh on Slack. He can def connect you with local startups and companies.**

I've also had this list from past years, but I haven't updated it recently so I'm not sure if these folks still need sites. If nothing else, you can reach out to these people:

-   <http://sparkboulder.com/> - DM @arieann on Slack
-   <http://govidit.com/> - DM @dannywalsh on Slack
