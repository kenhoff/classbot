**Prebuilt & Customizable themes**

Surprise! No recommended Treehouse watching for this session, but there is an optional video. Instead, I'd like you to start exploring **Prebuilt & Customizable themes**.

	- If you want to generate a custom Bootstrap theme, you can always do so by using http://getbootstrap.com/customize/. However, it does require you to know exactly what you want, and plug in all the styles yourself. Probably just be easier to use a prebuilt theme :)
