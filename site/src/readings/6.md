## CSS Box Model

-   [The CSS Box Model](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/the-css-box-model)
-   [Padding](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/padding)
-   [Borders](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/borders)
-   [Margins](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/margins)
    -   We've seen these before, when we were looking at the CSS Box Model. One thing to note here is the use of shorthand styles; e.g. using `margin` instead of `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom` and `margin-left`.
