## HTML tag attributes, the `style` attribute

-   [Inline and Internal Styles](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/getting-started-with-css/inline-and-internal-styles) **(recommended)**
    -   Only watch the first 5 minutes of this video. We'll watch the rest of it next time.
-   [Image Tags](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/html-the-structural-foundation-of-web-pages-and-applications/image-tags) **(recommended)**
    -   Image tags are great examples for tag attributes and self-closing tags!
-   [Anchor Tags](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/html-the-structural-foundation-of-web-pages-and-applications/anchor-tags) **(recommended)**
    -   It's also totally possible to wrap `<img>` tags with `<a>` tags!
-   [HTML Lists](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/html-the-structural-foundation-of-web-pages-and-applications/-html-lists) _(optional)_
    -   This one's optional, but I want to point out something interesting that she says in this video. She mentions that the main navigation and that the list of skills are both `<ol>` tags, but they're being styled by CSS. That's pretty cool!
