## HTML tags & attributes, the `style` attribute

-   [Welcome to HTML and CSS](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/-getting-familiar-with-html-and-css/welcome-to-html-and-css) **(recommended)**
    -   This video mentions a new concept: **CSS**, or _Cascading Style Sheets_. Don't worry too much about it yet - we'll start covering it in Session 4 or 5.
-   [Front End Web Dev vs Back End Web Dev](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/-getting-familiar-with-html-and-css/html-css-and-web-development) **(recommended)**
    -   It's a little fuzzy how Front End and Back End work together - this video explains it better.
-   [The Basic Structure of a Web Page](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/html-the-structural-foundation-of-web-pages-and-applications/the-basic-structure-of-a-web-page) **(recommended)**
    -   This video starts introducing some of the other tags that we have to be aware of, like `<html>` or `<head>`.
-   [Image Tags](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/html-the-structural-foundation-of-web-pages-and-applications/image-tags) **(recommended)**
    -   Image tags are great examples for tag attributes and self-closing tags!
-   [Anchor Tags](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/html-the-structural-foundation-of-web-pages-and-applications/anchor-tags) **(recommended)**
    -   It's also totally possible to wrap `<img>` tags with `<a>` tags!
-   [HTML Lists](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css/html-the-structural-foundation-of-web-pages-and-applications/-html-lists) _(optional)_
    -   This one's optional, but I want to point out something interesting that she says in this video. She mentions that the main navigation and that the list of skills are both `<ol>` tags, but they're being styled by CSS. That's pretty cool!
