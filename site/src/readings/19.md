# Readings 19

## Social Network Front End Show-and-Tell, wrap-up/party ðŸŽ‰

I'm going to have you build an app that displays a random quote whenever you visit the page!

Your Random Quote App must do three things:

-   When a user comes to the page, it displays a quote, pulled at random from a list of quotes
-   A user can click a button to get a new quote, pulled at random from a list of quotes
-   **A user can fill out a text box and submit a new quote to be included in the list of quotes**

Submit your Random Quote App with `submit 19 https://your-random-quote-app.firebaseapp.com`. You can also get this information with `assignment 19`. Remember to keep the site live after the class ends, so that potential employers and clients can see it!

But wait - you need a "backend" for the Random Quote App!

So I built one for you! `randomquote` is a REST API that allows you to retrieve quotes from lists of quotes, and add new quotes to lists of quotes.

Documentation is available at <http://randomquote.hoff.tech>.

For this project, you'll only need to do two main things:

-   Retrieve a random quote from a list of quotes
-   Add a new quote to a list of quotes

(but, the API provides many more functions than that! Feel free to use them)
