## jQuery 203: HTTP requests with jQuery

Two words - **Soul Patch**.

-   [jQuery's AJAX Shorthand Methods](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/ajax-basics/jquery-and-ajax/jquery-s-ajax-shorthand-methods)
    -   Notice that in this case, we're using just `$.get()`, not `$(".someClass").get()`.
    -   I haven't used the `.load()` method before. Mess around with it if you want - I generally have other preferred ways to get "templates" built into sites.
-   [Posting Data with jQuery](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/ajax-basics/jquery-and-ajax/posting-data-with-jquery)
    -   Again, using `$.post()` instead of `$(".someClass").post()`.
    -   We haven't gone over forms - most sites you visit these days don't use a "submitting" form anymore. They usually override the `submit` method on the form, then send the data via AJAX - that way, they don't have to refresh the page to add new data to the page.
