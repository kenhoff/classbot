## The `display` and `position` styles

-   [Display Values](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/display-values)
    -   This video covers the `display` attributes and the values `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`. One of the cool things that he does in this video is turning a bunch of `<li>` tags into a horizontal list, like a nav menu!

-   [Positioning Elements Relative to Other Elements](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-layout-basics/positioning-page-content/positioning-elements-relative-to-other-elements)
    -   At this point, we start getting into some weirdness with CSS layouts. A "positioned" element is one that has `display` set to `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`. Absolutely positioned elements will only be positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor, which I guarantee makes no sense right now, but we'll work through it!
-   [Fixed Positioning](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-layout-basics/positioning-page-content/fixed-positioning)
    -   Ey! This is how you'd get one of those navbars that stays stuck to the top of the page, even while you're scrolling down.
    -   Don't forget some padding for the elements _underneath_ the fixed navbar! Otherwise, some of your stuff at the top is going to be cut off.
-   [How Z-index Works](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-layout-basics/positioning-page-content/how-zindex-works)
    -   Generally, if you want a fixed top navbar, you're going to want the `z-index` of that to be the highest on the page.
    -   One catch that they may or not talk about is the difference between `absolute` and `relative` positions. I'd recommend checking out the [documentation on the `position` style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Relative_positioning) - in particular, the examples with the red squares do a pretty good job of showing the difference between `absolute` and `relative`.
