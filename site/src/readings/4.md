**Portfolio Site Show-and-Tell, Lab session**

Hey, no readings this week! Instead, I'd like you to have a look at a bunch of different portfolio sites, and see if anything inspires you.

Not all of these are good, but they should at least all be interesting. They’re friends’ portfolios, or sites that were sent to me by friends.

A lot of these are pretty advanced! Try to keep yours as simple as possible - you can always update it with a lot of super-fanciness later.
