## Flexbox
<!--
## CSS layouts, the `display` style, flexbox & media queries

### The CSS Box Model **(recommended)**

-   [The CSS Box Model](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/the-css-box-model)
-   [Padding](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/padding)
-   [Borders](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/borders)
-   [Margins](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/margins)
    -   We've seen these before, when we were looking at the CSS Box Model. One thing to note here is the use of shorthand styles; e.g. using `margin` instead of `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom` and `margin-left`.

### Flexbox **(recommended)**

-   [Flexbox Basics and Terminology](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-flexbox-layout/understanding-flexbox/flexbox-basics-and-terminology)
-   [Creating a Flex container](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-flexbox-layout/understanding-flexbox/creating-a-flex-container)
    -   I really wish he didn't bring up `inline-flex` in this one - we don't really use it much, and it just ends up being confusing. Ignore it!
-   [Vertical and Horizontal Centering](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-flexbox-layout/flexbox-properties/vertical-and-horizontal-centering)
    -   Setting `margin: auto` on a flex container's child element is one of the secret weapons of web devs. Use it! Ignore the other methods that he uses, unless you really want to understand flexbox more.
-   [A guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
    -   Skim over this one and bookmark it. This is the literally the best page on the internet for understanding flexbox.
-   [Display Values](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/the-box-model/display-values) _(optional)_
    -   This video covers the `display` attributes and the values `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`. One of the cool things that he does in this video is turning a bunch of `<li>` tags into a horizontal list, like a nav menu!
-   [Media Queries](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/responsive-layouts/media-queries/media-query-review) **(required)**
    -   How does Bootstrap's responsiveness work? Media Queries! Chances are you won't need media queries for a long time (because Bootstrap handles all of this stuff for us), **but** they're important to know about, in case you need to go in to modify them. -->
