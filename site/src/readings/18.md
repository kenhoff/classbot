## Advanced Topics: Back End Web Development with Node.js

For our **Advanced Topics** session, we'll be learning about **Back End Web Development** using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)!

-   [Node.js - Hello World](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics/introduction-to-nodejs/hello-world) **(recommended)**
    -   Writing Node.js is basically just writing Javascript, except that you run it using the command line, instead of inside a browser.
-   **How to install `express` in a Node.js Project:** Navigate to your project folder, and run `npm install express`. (You'll need to have Node.js installed, which you should already have.)
-   [Your First Express App](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics/getting-started-with-express/your-first-express-app) **(recommended)**
    -   Holy crap, they sure take their time getting to this point. **Make sure that you've run `npm install express` in your project directory, otherwise `require("express")` won't work.**
-   [HTTP Request Format](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/http-basics/introduction-to-http/http-request-format) and [HTTP Response Format](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/http-basics/introduction-to-http/http-response-format) _(optional)_
    -   Don't worry about using `telnet` for anything and don't worry about much of the headers and data formats in the requests - the important takeaway here is that `GET` HTTP requests are used to **read** data, and `POST` HTTP requests are used to **update** data.
-   [Using Anchors for GET Requests](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/http-basics/get-and-post-requests-in-a-browser/using-anchors-for-get-requests) _(optional)_
    -   Turns out that we've been using HTTP requests all along, whenever we use an `<a>` tag.
-   [JavaScript without the Browser](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics/introduction-to-nodejs/javascript-without-the-browser) _(optional)_
    -   This is a great way of looking at it - fundamentally, a lot of JavaScript in the browser is the same as in Node.js, except for the stuff that's specific to the two different environments - for example, `window` on the browser, and `fs` (filesystem) in Node.js.
