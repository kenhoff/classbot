# Readings 3

## CSS styles and selectors, external stylesheets

-   [Inline and Internal Styles](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/getting-started-with-css/inline-and-internal-styles) **(recommended)**
    -   We watched the first 5 minutes of this one in the last readings, so watch from 5 minutes til the end.
    -   So far, we've only used **Inline Styles** (the `style` attributes on all of our tags). This video introduces **Internal Styles**, which are `<style>` tags placed in the `<head>` of the page.
    -   Using **Internal Styles** is generally always better than using **Inline Styles**!
-   [External Style Sheets](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/getting-started-with-css/external-style-sheets) **(recommended)**
    -   Using **External Style Sheets** is generally always better than using **Internal** or **Inline Styles**!
-   [Intro to Selectors](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/intro-to-selectors) **(recommended)**
    -   **Selectors** are what we use to pick elements on the page that we'd like to style.
-   [Type Selectors](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/type-selectors) **(recommended)**
    -   These selectors select certain **types of elements** to style on the page.
-   [ID Selectors](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/id-selectors) **(recommended)** and [Class Selectors](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/class-selectors) **(recommended)**
    -   ID and Class selectors style all elements that have a given `id` or `class`.
-   [Reusing Classes](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/reusing-classes) _(optional)_
    -   You can add multiple `class`es to a tag to make things a bit easier. (But you should probably avoid adding multiple `id`s to a tag!)
-   [Descendant Selectors](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/descendant-selectors-2) _(optional)_
    -   We can use Descendant Selectors to style certain `<p>`s inside a certain `.class`, or `<li>`s inside a `#navbar`.
-   **Background Images and Position**
    -   [Color and Images](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-layout/backgrounds-color-and-images) **(recommended)**
    -   [Size and Position](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-layout/backgrounds-size-and-position) **(recommended)**
        -   There's a bunch of times when we want text or divs over an image - `background-image` fixes that for us.
-   [Border Radius](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/designing-with-the-latest-features/border-radius-2) _(optional)_
    -   `border-radius` is handy when we've got to round the corners of a `div`, but looks better when we've got a `background-image` assigned.
-   [The Cascade](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/fundamental-concepts/the-cascade-importance) & [Specificity and Source Order](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/fundamental-concepts/the-cascade-specificity-and-source-order) _(optional)_
    -   We touched on specificity last time - these videos don't go into detail, but does give some examples that might help.
