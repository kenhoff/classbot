*CSS styles and selectors, external stylesheets*

<https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/getting-started-with-css/inline-and-internal-styles|Inline and Internal Styles> *(recommended)*
	- So far, we've only used *Inline Styles* (the `style` attributes on all of our tags). This video introduces *Internal Styles*, which are `<style>` tags placed in the `<head>` of the page.
	- Using *Internal Styles* is generally always better than using *Inline Styles*!

	- Using *External Style Sheets* is generally always better than using *Internal* or *Inline Styles*!

	- *Selectors* are what we use to pick elements on the page that we'd like to style.

<https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/type-selectors|Type Selectors> *(recommended)*
	- These selectors select certain *types of elements* to style on the page.

<https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/id-selectors) *(recommended)* and [Class Selectors](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/class-selectors|ID Selectors> *(recommended)*
	- ID and Class selectors style all elements that have a given `id` or `class`.

	- You can add multiple `class`es to a tag to make things a bit easier. (But you should probably avoid adding multiple `id`s to a tag!)

<https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-selectors/descendant-selectors-2|Descendant Selectors> _(optional)_
	- We can use Descendant Selectors to style certain `<p>`s inside a certain `.class`, or `<li>`s inside a `#navbar`.

*Background Images and Position*

	<https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/basic-layout/backgrounds-size-and-position|Size and Position> *(recommended)*
		- There's a bunch of times when we want text or divs over an image - `background-image` fixes that for us.

<https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics/designing-with-the-latest-features/border-radius-2|Border Radius> _(optional)_
	- `border-radius` is handy when we've got to round the corners of a `div`, but looks better when we've got a `background-image` assigned.

	- We touched on specificity last time - these videos don't go into detail, but does give some examples that might help.
