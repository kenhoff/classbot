## Javascript 101: the `<script>` tag

-   [JavaScript Everywhere](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics/introducing-javascript/javascript-everywhere) **(recommended)**
    -   JavaScript originally started as just for the browser, but has since expanded to run just about everywhere. Fun facts - `npm` (which we use to install our Firebase tools) and Atom are both written in JavaScript!
-   [Your First JavaScript Program](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics/introducing-javascript/your-first-javascript-program-2) and [Where Does JavaScript Go?](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics/introducing-javascript/where-does-javascript-go) **(recommended)**
    -   One thing that's not as clear in these videos - it's totally possible for us to include scripts inside of `<script>` tags directly in an HTML page, much like we were doing with internal styles.
-   [The JavaScript Console](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics/introducing-javascript/the-javascript-console) **(recommended)**
    -   The console is one of the single most valuable debugging tools for web development. It'll show you if you have a syntax error in your script, or if jQuery isn't included and it needs to be, and lots of other things.
-   [A Short History of JavaScript](https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript) _(optional)_
    -   The year: 1995. The company: Netscape. The developer: Brendan Eich. The result: an absolute clusterf\*ck of a  language that is still in use today, more than 20 years later.
